Not til you see people emerging from the basement would you know there\\'s a downstairs. Wine selection is different. The wines are from regions of the world not really known for wines. Lebanon? Israel? Good wines, I must say. A bit expensive. Food is good. A tad expensive as well. Salmon BLT is made with raw, smoked salmon, which is delicious. It got crowded for a small stretch. But it seemed as though people were stopping by for a drink before venturing on. Down side, the bartenders (3 of them, it seemed) seemed over whelmed by the number of people upstairs at one point as well as a full house downstairs.

This place is LOUD. The hostess sat us next to 2 high school kids and the guy was the #1 most annoying human being I've ever had the pleasure of sitting next to. Basically, he yelled his conquests across the table and managed to say F#$% 22 times in less than 5 minutes. I'm not exactly a delicate flower but on this particular night, I had brought my mom who was visiting from Texas. She was horrified. Shortly after we sat down, the two girls on our other side were leaving so I asked our waitress (Lauren) if we could move to that table because we did not feel comfortable in our current spot and could not enjoy our meal. She told us that she couldn't move us because they like to hold that table for a party of 3. So, why did those 2 girls get to sit there? Why are they better than us? She said she would check. Never heard back from her regarding the situation. Our food came a couple minutes later and we tried to get through the meal inches from the F-bomber. The table sat empty for the rest of our visit. 1 star for service. I can respect a policy if it is fairly enforced. If you only enforce the policy for some guests and not others, then you are discriminating. Was I pissed that 2 other girls got to sit there and enjoy their meal while I had to wince through mine? Absolutely. Was I pissed that the table sat empty for the entire evening? Definitely. Was I pissed that the waitress treated possible guests coming off the street better than her existing ones? For sure. It's a damn shame because I really liked this place and would definitely go back in the future. As of now, I will never return to this location.\",\n",
       " \"A girlfriend of mine was visiting from out of town and selected Obao as the venue for her reunion dinner. I have to say, I had my doubts as I walked down 9th Ave, because of the location... but I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived. Obao's interior is trendy for a Thai restaurant, and does not reflect the price point of their menu items. (I would have expected it to be more expensive.) As I was led upstairs, I was even more surprised because it was the perfect setup for hosting an intimate dinner party. We had about 16 people in our group, and there was another large party on the other side of the room. Everyone enjoyed themselves and there were no hiccups in service or food. And seriously, the food was great. The drunken noodles were the best I've ever had - it wasn't greasy and I finished my entire plate. My favorite part? The pleasant surprise of paying less than I expected when I received my bill. Would totally come back again. A great place for a casual date night or gathering with close friends. The only drawback that I can think of is that Obao is out of the way for me, but for good Thai food at a very fair price, add to that the trendy decor and cozy ambiance, I would definitely return! Obao is definitely a cut above your average Thai restaurant, and yet it still maintains that no-frills vibe that makes me such a big fan of this place.

However, the food was definitely delicious and worth it. I had the stamina dip soba. They only offer it as a warm soba on the menu but I asked the waitress about having it as a dip and she said it was do-able but we had to add $1 which was totally fine with me. My friend got the chicken meatball dip soba and we ordered a few appetizers, the roast duck, homemade silky tofu and the steamed chicken meatballs. I really enjoyed my stamina soba and loved the bits of ground chicken in it. The broth was so tasty and the noodles were al dente. My only complaint was how uncomfortable it was eating the soba because we had to be very careful not to knock down the pot of boiling broth but there was barely any room to move our arms. My friend also really enjoyed her meatball soba and raved about how good the meatballs tasted which I concur. The appetizers were also pretty good, I really liked the roast duck and the blueberry dip that it was paired with. I never knew duck with blueberry would taste so amazing! The silky tofu was also very excellent. You can never go wrong with a simply dish like that, just add scallions, soy sauce and some grated ginger and you have yourself a delicious appetizer. The steamed chicken meatballs was a little disappointing though. It did not taste as good as the chicken meatballs in the soba and was too heavy for me with the sticky rice. It was also overly salty even without the dipping sauce. Lastly, we had the tofu dessert which was absolutely divine! The Japanese really have perfected the art of making tofu and it was one of the best desserts I have ever had. If you are looking for a dessert that is not overly sweet with subtle flavors then this is it! I would definitely come back again and try their other dishes.',\n",

Somehow,the chicken was incredibly moist, tender, and flavorful, not the dreaded overcooked dried out chicken breast that plagues many a restaurant plate. \\xa0It was encircled by a delicious green sauce, and accompanied by butter beans and fresh tasting brussels sprout leaves, as well as a mashed potato side. \\xa0Despite being pretty full from the first few dishes, we demolished our portions in seconds. \\xa0My father chose his favorite protein, duck, which he appreciated (though he thought our chicken was better). \\xa0It came with a rich, buttery chestnut sauce which I sampled and enjoyed. \\xa0My brother went with the kobe beef cheeks with blue kale gnocchi...I tried them and they were very tender but had a bit of a strange, sour, vinegary taste which he liked, but I didn\\'t as much. Extra course: All four of us got a plate of foie gras drizzled in a rich creamy sauce. \\xa0I couldn\\'t handle more than a few bites at this point (stomach space was rapidly disappearing) but luckily the guys helped me out. \\xa0Those few bites were ridiculously decadent, though.

       " \"It's difficult to love Italian food (especially pasta) and not know of this restaurant or the family behind it. Lydia Bastianich has made her dent in the world of Italian food, and over 20 years ago, opened Becco with the help of her son, Joe. Since then, it's happily served tourists, theater-goers, native New Yorkers, and Italian food lovers alike. A few friends and I met up at Becco during a weekday evening and made our way inside just a few minutes earlier than our reservation. What greeted us was a bright, clamorous dining room; two rows of tables were lined against the side of the room and each and every seat appeared to be filled. Even the bar area was completely packed, with some patrons opting to have their dinner there instead of waiting for a table. We waited for about 10 or 15 minutes until our table was ready and were led past the kitchen to the second dining room, which thankfully had a slightly less chaotic ambiance. There was pretty much no need to look at the menu, as we'd already decided beforehand on our orders. Becco's known for their unlimited tableside pasta service, an option that allows diners to choose between a salad or antipasto misto appetizer, followed by a hypothetically unlimited amount of three different pastas. I opted for the Insalata Cesare, the Caesar Salad, while my friend got the second option. The salad is pretty typical - crisp romaine lettuce, crunchy blocks of croutons, a sprinkling of grated Grana Padano (a cheese that falls in the same family as Parmigiano-Reggiano), and lightly mixed with a dressing that was not timid with its use of anchovies and garlic. For the more adventurous, the antipasto misto offers more variety, including a selection of cheeses, marinated and grilled vegetables, and seafood. The pastas are brought out in huge pots intermittently by servers who will stop by tables and ladle out a serving (or two) of the desired pasta onto plates. On the evening we went, we able to try a \\xa0spaghetti pomodoro, a mushroom ravioli topped with a cream sauce, and a fusilli alla bolognese. The least favorite of the night turned out to the ravioli; the pasta was served at a lukewarm temperature and the liberal amount of cheese in the filling completely overwhelmed any mushroom flavor. Surprisingly, the simplest pasta of the night was the standout; the pasta had a good chew to each bite, and the pomodoro sauce was fresh and well-balanced, with a generous helping of oregano and basil to compliment the acidity. The servings are fairly generous, and we were stuffed by our second plates; you will not leave here hungry. The overall quality of restaurants on Restaurant Row isn't particularly worth noting, but amongst this selection, Becco clearly has its strengths. While it may not be worth a separate trip out, it's a solid option for a pre or post-theater meal, especially when there are few other options on the horizon.\",\n",

He listened patiently, told me that he was sorry, that this was not normal, that they have a fine kitchen and a loyal following; he took our address, and said that he wished we would give them a second chance. \\xa0A week or so later, a $20 gift certificate showed up in a card, which I thought was nice. \\xa0That said, I was not eager to try the restaurant again. \\xa0 Months passed, and I finally went back with a friend intending to have some cocktails and appetizers in the lounge. \\xa0It was empty when we arrived, and we sat at the bar. \\xa0The specialty drink list was short but thoughtful, and the cocktails themselves were very good. \\xa0We sat there for about an hour, and were debating ordering food or going someplace else when the bartender said to us, \"sorry ladies, but if you\\'re not ordering anything else, I have people waiting for those seats.\" \\xa0There was indeed a couple next to us, and only one seat for the two of them. \\xa0There were also, I might add, two large sectionals in back of us. Empty. \\xa0Problem solved, decision made. \"Check, please\". \\xa0It was hilarious to me that this was, in the words of the manager, their \"second chance\".',\n",

There was also a few specials. We started with a special - homemade ricotta with blackberries - and another cheese. Their pasta menu looked awesome. I got the cavatelli with spicy lamb sausage and swiss chard. Perfectly flavored portion (in that greedy, hungry me wishes there was more) that left room for dessert. My friend got the bucatini and I tried a bite. Solid as well. We shared the following desserts. I love variety! - bittersweet chocolate budino with vanilla cream and chocolate-honey crisp: I love budinos and as someone who does not like super-rich/heavy chocolate desserts, this satisfied. - olive oil cake with raisin marmelatta, vin santo, creme fraiche mousse: I think the table has never seen olive oil cake before. Good portion for sharing. Pretty good. - coconut semifreddo with almond cake, chocolate ganache: I loved this because I love coconut anything. - creme fraiche panna cotta with peach-moscato granita, blueberry compote: My friend started out saying she dislikes panna cottas. Obviously she's never had a good one and this changed her mind. This and the olive oil cake were the crowd favorites. Service was ok - unmemorable. We got what we needed.\",\n",

That alone is enough of a reason to give it a shot. I was a bit disappointed when I found out that they don't serve those massive dumplings I had seen on TV, but was pleased to know that they serve some of the tastiest lil treats this side of Chinatown! We ordered the crab meat and pork meat dumplings to see which one was best. Where to begin... the first lil bite of these lil guys is fantastic! Allowing the piping hot soup to billow out of the fragile moist shell and onto your palate. It's foodgasmic! Perfect to have on a cold night in the city .. or after a night of heavy drinking. I preferred the pork ones over the crab meat, but they were both delicious. The only reason I am not giving Joe's a 4 or 5 rating is because their other dishes lacked a bit. The general tso's was dry and overcooked. The chunks of chicken that were served were a bit fatty and didn't make me want more. Although, the scallion pancakes were excellent!!!!

The place where we sat was a bit inconvenient because there wasn't any place for us to put our belongings except on the floor (chairs were backless and the tables weren't very spacious), and well, it being NYC, that wasn't really an option for us. \\xa0 Overall, it is a restaurant I'd do a return visit with.\",\n",

No apologies were made when a salad was not delivered with other starters. When starters were cleared from the table the server took used forks off the finished plates and placed them on the table. As my friend said they give you clean forks even at Chilli's. Odd. At the end of the meal a spoon was brought out with cheese and I had to ask the server which cheese was which. The food lacked any innovation. Mixed green salads were pretty dry. The Caesar with anchovies and pancetta was nice and salty from the ingredients; I like salt. The cheese in the grilled the cheese was melted between two slices of bread cut about an inch thick. Very good. The mac and cheese had thick noodles in it and a good crust. Hanger steak frites was cooked perfectly with a nice char. The Shepherd's pie had all the ingredients of a Shepherd's pie but had consistency more close to a stew. I though of Irish stew with mash in it when I tried it. Pumpkin pie had a great pumpkin flavor while not being overly sweet and was topped with fresh whipped cream. Everything was very fresh. Only Wine and beer are served and at reasonable prices. Every bottle of wine is available by the glass. The young chef is very nice and started out as a formagier in Boston.

We shared some Tapas, including the Tortilla Espagnola (Egg/Potato omlettely thing) which is my favorite. We also had an Octopus Salad, Lamb, and something else which I can't remember. The food was delicious and the portions were predictably tapas sized which I was okay with. Bonus - They open up the windows so you can semi-sit outside while still sitting inside (does that even make sense?) . I would definitely come back .. I only wish they served Paella..\",\n",

I\\'m always fascinated that NY\\'s brunch is offered till 3:00pm, with 1:30 or so probably at it\\'s height. The restaurant is bustling--very loud and crowded. (Reservations here seem to be a must.) \\xa0We\\'re seated at a table that does not seat three very comfortably, but cozy in a corner, and better than a wait. Even in close quarters, it\\'s hard to hear each other...voices everywhere seem raised, and didn\\'t help the music playing was on the loud side, too. Our server was friendly, but wasn\\'t super attentive, as he probably had too many other tables to attend to. Still and sparkling water was offered. Our order was taken and coffee and complementary cocktail delivered quick enough. Coffee--not so strong, kinda watery. Blood orange mimosa--not so strong, kinda watery. I order \"the croaker,\" their take on the \"croque madame.\" Clever, fun name. The sandwich is open faced, which I appreciate--less carbs, really. Might be about the only real thing I truly appreciated about the sandwich itself. The ham was not that great quality, sliced thin and piled high (overwhelming). Cheese was decent, and egg was too runny. I realized later the server didn\\'t ask how I preferred my eggs. (Over medium, please, thanks anyways!) Overall, I enjoyed the sandwich, as those flavors just go so well together. The home fries were phenomenal--scalloped and nicely fried...probably then baked in the oven to finish them off, and seasoned perfectly. The potatoes I finished, the sandwich, not so much... In the end, we all enjoyed a nice brunch in a nice venue. A-OK in my book, but have gone to much better brunches in NY. \\xa0(A dime a dozen out there, no?!)',\n",

       " \"Doors open precisely at 5:30 PM, so if you plan on getting there early on a rainy or cold day, don't expect to be let in any earlier. As soon as you walk in, you're greeted in Japanese. Just to the right, is a chef freshly making the soba noodles. It almost reminded me of my experiences of Rakuichi in Niseko, Japan. The establishment is small, with a dozen tables and another several single person seats wrapping around a L-shaped bar near the back of the restaurant. If it's your first time eating soba, you can opt for hot or cold. I prefer the cold as you really get to enjoy the freshness, texture, and flavor of the noodles as opposed to one being soaked in the broth. Scallions and wasabi are served on the side. Zaru (200 grams for $12.25), is a perfect introduction to cold soba, which includes a bed of soba sitting on a zaru (sieve-like bamboo mat) garnished with nori seaweed, tsuyu which is a dipping sauce for the soba, and a side serving of wasabi and scallions. Many might suggest to put the wasabi and scallions in the tsuyu, but I like to mix the wasabi with the soba. I then take a small amount of the soba and dip in in the tsuyu. I slowly mix it in, then slurp it up with my chopsticks, making sure to breathe air in as I suck. I find sucking air with the soba adds another layer of aroma and flavor. I learned these two tips from the Rakuichi chef straight from my visit to Japan....Yum!! There is a dinner pre-fixe menu ($18) that lets you try a little of everything. The first part of the pre-fixe is the appetizer, which is an assortment of 4 tastings varying from Kimpira Gobo (pan sauteed mountain burdock), Kabocha ( cooked Japanese squash), marinated lotus root, and a green vegetable. Each excels in different Japanese flavors and textures that will surely excite the taste buds. Next is your choice of hot or cold soba/udon noodles. Served on the side is vegetable & shrimp tempura which consists of 2 pieces of shrimp, 1 brocolli floret, and 1 thin sliced sweet potato. The batter is very light, airy, fresh and far from greasy, exactly how tempura should be prepared. Included on the side are 2 pieces of cold Inari sushi, which is a pouch of fried tofu filled with sushi rice. The sweetness of the fried tofu helps to take the edge off things, which I found myself devouring. Lastly, top top things off is a scoop of vanilla ice cream with strawberry. Soba-ya definitely offers some pretty fresh and delicious soba. The authenticity, freshness, and flavors are all there to make for a very enjoyable experience. However, there just seemed to be something missing. It may be because I'm comparing it to my unforgettable experience at Rakuichi, which is the best soba I've ever had, but so far Soba-ya have come the closest. I definitely recommend checking out Soba-ya out.\",\n",

       " 'If I knew how to do it, AC would get Zero Stars from me. Last week I had a number of clients and vendors here for a work related project and tried to think of a nice place to take them for dinner. We had read a number of good things about Audrey Claire, so I checked Yelp, then called AC for details. I learned that it is a cash only business and BYOB so I had to herd the guests, go buy wine, and stop at the ATM. \\xa0That was ok but not the easiest thing to do at the end of a long work day. If it was a good meal, as I had anticipated, it might have been worth it. Eek! Methinksnot. When we stepped inside we discovered it was so loud the waiter could not hear our pleas to \"please let us out of here.\" \\xa0Using hand signals, we were able to manage to get moved to outside seats where we thought we finally arrived at a nice meal. \\xa0 We had to have several small metal tables pushed together to accommodate our group. \\xa0We referred to some guests who were at a small table on the lower side of the sidewalk as being at the \"kids table.\" \\xa0We were greeted nicely by Max and Christine our server. \\xa0We thought the menu looked good, especially for those of us who love vegetables and wanted to eat the smaller sized dishes. I guess my one star can be attributed to the fact that AC let us have most dishes without the cheese, making them healthy vegetable meals. The food was ok, not spectacular, but I was happy that beets, squashes and brussel sprouts were prominently displayed. After we ate, we discovered that AC does not give you receipts for your meal. The check didn\\'t even look like a real check; you could not tell how the addition was actually done. \\xa0I asked our server for a receipt. I explained that it was a business dinner and I need a receipt to get reimbursed. I had just spent several hundred dollars for small plates of veggies, traipsed through center city to find wine to bring with me, and won\\'t get reimbursed for for the meal? \\xa0 Are you kidding AC? \\xa0Why wouldn\\'t you give a receipt? I can only conclude that AC doesn\\'t want my business. \\xa0So, I won\\'t be back. PS: \\xa0I am writing this update to clarify what I wrote about AC. The service was terrific and the food was good. Like I mentioned above, the vegetable variety was great, and Max and Christine nicely greeted us and accommodated our requests to be moved outside, sit together, and order small plates for a group of five. The restaurant however is not designed for large (five people) work-related groups. It was too loud (perhaps that is a sign of its success?), the tables were not large enough to sit us away from the noise easily; it is cash only making it difficult (at least for this card-carrying girl) to spend a lot of money; and the lack of a receipt makes it impossible for someone (at least everywhere I have ever worked) to get reimbursed. So, this might be a nice place for someone else. It was not a nice place for me to entertain out of town guests for dinner.',\n",

I stumbled onto Taqueria Lower East Side when my lady suggested we hit up a bar in the LES. \\xa0We had just started dating and I frantically searched Yelp for a decent bar with decent bar food. \\xa0After reading the reviews up at the time, I suggested Taqueria LES. When we walked in, my heart sank when I realized that this was obviously a restaurant and not a traditional bar. It was right after work and the place was pretty empty. \\xa0My lady, being the classy sweet girl she is, smiled and sat down as we decided to stay and give it a try. \\xa0We've been hooked ever since. Food: Salsa and Chips are free for the table and we opted for the $7 guacamole. \\xa0We were not disappointed. The salsa is more like a puree, spicy and authentic. The guacamole was among the best I've had. Creamy, lots of lime (which I love), not too salty and topped with fresh cilantro and diced onions... I'm salivating now just thinking about it. \\xa0Best part, they give you a healthy serving - we almost never finish it whenever we visit. If you read my other reviews you will find that I tend to find one item on the menu and stick to it. \\xa0I have a long list of places which I go for pizza, tacos, burritos, burgers...etc. \\xa0At Taqueria LES, I have only had the steak tacos, I love them so much, that though I am tempted to try some of their other offerings, I cannot bring myself to order anything else. \\xa0Same goes for my lady... \\xa0That being said, these steak tacos are the best I've had. \\xa0They are served on two soft corn tortillas, which are topped with cilantro, diced onions, a dollop of a very spicy (and I mean spicy - I love spicy food but this is definitely hot) \\xa0but delicious salsa, a wedge of lime and of course, a slice of radish. \\xa0 The steak is grilled, nicely flavored and is enhanced and not overpowered by the toppings. We always opt for a side of crema (do not dare ask for sour cream) and suggest to folks to spread that salsa or remove some of it if you are sensitive to spicy food. Spiciness will vary from night to night but its alway hot. The tacos are cheap and pretty filling, I always have two, occasionally 3 if I am super hungry. \\xa0 Drinks: I have always HATED margaritas until I had a Taqueria LES margarita. \\xa0Its fresh, not too sweet, and made with pretty good tequila (one day I'll remember to ask which one they use). \\xa0I get mine with salt and relish in the tart, refreshing drink every single time. \\xa0I should mention its a nice size! They serve traditional Mexican beer and have a nice selection of tequila for folks to choose from, but at $8 bucks a glass, you will be hard pressed to beat the house margarita. \\xa0 Misc: The wait staff is pretty laid back, which could be seen as inattentive but I have not had that experience. If you are a regular (like me), you will be greeted with a smile. They do get busy after 7pm and often times there is a wait but nothing ridiculous. \\xa0They have rules and they stick by em, which I appreciate but others may find peculiar - its a southern california style place, though I often wonder why they choose to include LES in the name.

Like I said, Green sauce is crucial to having a successful Peruvian chicken experience. The kind served at Pio Pio is one of the best. Its creamy, spicy, tangy and insanely addictive. You can actually buy the sauce in a jar at Pio Pio for $5, but what\\'s actually in it is a secret ( I love food secrets!). Jim had the presence of mind to order EIGHT. He is smart. Sides? Yes please. We went with a good mix of Salchipapas (papas fritas and sausages that look like red hot dogs), Yuca Frites (thick, starchy wedges of fried yuca with a garlic sauce), and Maduros (grilled sweet plantains).

There\\'s no dessert menu, and your choices are the Fois Gras Doughnut (I still can\\'t see how this is appetizing to people) or a frozen snickers bar.

       " 'Yakitori Boy, for those of you who haven\\'t lived in Japan, is essentially an \"izakaya\" - a restaurant serving small meals - like tapas - in a setting designed to be attended with friends. In Japanese, the characters in the word \"izakaya\" include the character for \"sake\" - so usually the goal is to eat and drink until you\\'re happy! I took a group of about 16 on a Saturday night in January. We were generally impressed, and very few of us were there for the sushi. (There were two friends of mine visiting from Tokyo and another three - including me - who were excited for the idea of \"izakaya\" dining in Philadelphia. The few sushi dishes that were ordered were actually very well prepared, and the okonomiyaki was excellent (although I still prefer it from the lunch counter at Maido). The takoyaki was perfect - too perfect, maybe, for a food that\\'s meant to be a festival food booth treat. The yakitori was well priced, and definitely cooked properly. Biggest issues were: (1) the lack of a liquor license, which was easily solved by running to the booze store on 12th street (there\\'s also one on Chestnut around the corner from Lolita), and that definitely kept the cost of dining down - it will be interesting to see if it\\'s still a great deal once they get their license (our bill was about $25/person); (2) the servers, although friendly, messed up the order a couple of times - having lived in Japan, I know that those little touchscreen ordering panels (like at Wawa) are an amazing boon for izakaya, especially since it\\'s usually large groups like mine; and (3) the fact that all the karaoke rooms were full when we tried to book them. Biggest surprises: Actually being able to speak Japanese in Philadelphia with the staff of a restaurant; the fact that the girl who runs the karaoke upstairs went to the same university in Japan that I went to/taught at; and, sadly the fact that I have now have to redo my business plan I\\'ve been trying to propose because someone already beat my idea for an izakaya in Philadelphia with karaoke booths and took the location I wanted.

If the weather was nicer, we would have sat outside. It\\'s very cute outside. At the bar, the bartender was attentive and nice. The really good brunch items cost extra money so the items that you\\'re allowed to choose from the menu are just the basics. We got the forager mushroom pizza, the polenta, French toast, and a side of the fennel sausage. The polenta tasted like airplane food, like the main entree on your airplane plate. The pizza was difficult to eat because it was so thin and hard. I love mushrooms and truffles but I didn\\'t get that from the pizza... it was under-seasoned. And the chili oil was not spicy, it was just oil with a red color... The French toast was good and my favorite dish was the side of fennel sausage! WTH.

St. Louis Ribs - I\\'m more of a wet guy than dry rub, but these were perfect. \\xa0not my preference, but they did a nice job with the dry rub.

She told us our food would be served with a \"flow\", i.e. if an entrée is ready before we\\'re done with the appetizers, it will be brought to the table to keep the meal free-flowing rather than a course by course meal. The low rating is because we said we were going to a show afterwards & specifically said we needed to leave by 9:30pm, but we weren\\'t served dessert until about 9:40pm. Our waitress was amazing when she was with us, but to be honest, most of the time she was MIA & difficult to find. 5 stars for the food! My group decided to share everything. You get really generous servings here, & I highly recommend going with friends who don\\'t mind sharing because you really get a much more diverse experience with the food. We came during restaurant week, which is a great deal. I loved their food but am not sure it would\\'ve been completely worth the regular prices. You walk in & automatically think trendy, trendy, trendy. They keep the restaurant pretty dark for dinner, a pet peeve of mine since I can\\'t see my food - I\\'m a visual person. ENTREES - Chicken shish taouk - the chicken was very tender but it was slightly burnt on the outside. - Ilili burger - by far the most popular entrée. The burger was cooked perfectly & was delicious. - Fried skate - incredibly creative dish: you take a piece of endive, scoop up the hummus, some almonds, mandarin, & a piece of skate & it is absolutely delicious. I\\'ve never had fish with all these different flavors before & we all loved this. - Beef kebab - the beef was cooked perfectly, so tender & juicy! I wouldn\\'t say much for the pita & peppers though, as the peppers were a little overpowering (though if you REALLY like spicy you\\'d probably enjoy it), but dang the meat was good. APPETIZERS - Hommus - not much here; literally a plate of hummus with some spices. We probably shouldn\\'t have wasted an appetizer on this. - Fava bean salad - not especially memorable, a soupy plate of beans, served cool. - Kibbeh Nayeh (tartar of beef) - very interesting dish! It felt weird eating raw ground beef, but our server explained we\\'re supposed to mash it flat with your fork, scoop it up with pita bread, & eat with either some onion or pepper. Really unique experience, & you can change the flavor of each bite with the onions/pepper. - Falafel - we couldn\\'t get enough of this - it went fast - as it was so soft & delicious. The sauce that came with it was perfect too. - Steamed clams - I thought this would have some cool exotic spice or flavoring but it was just standard steamed clams. Also, was it just me or were half the clams just empty shells? The sauce was a little creamy for my liking as well - just personal preference. - Warm eggplant - Wow! This was one of the most popular appetizers at our table. There were a lot of \"I didn\\'t know eggplant could taste this good\" comments. They were really well seasoned, a little tangy/salty/sour with just the perfect mixture. The only thing is they weren\\'t that warm, I almost though they were supposed to be served cool until I remembered the name of the dish. - Bone marrow - everyone at my table loved this. You fill these little pita bread pouches first with a little bone marrow, & then you stuff the rest with tabbouleh (cherry - a nice touch). - Veal sweetbreads - delicious! Well seasoned & cooked perfectly. DESSERTS - Homemade Lebanese ice cream (pistachio) - I\\'ve tried a LOT of pistachio ice cream, & this is by far the best I\\'ve ever had! The texture was so smooth & rich, & the flavor authentic, like you\\'re tasting real pistachios but somehow better. - Achta - I wasn\\'t incredibly impressed with this dessert. It was basically two balls that were some sort of dairy/cream product. The consistency to me felt like butter, so it tasted like flavorless balls of fat to me. When you had it with the banana & syrup (sweet/tart), the flavors mixed really well, but the consistency still weirded me out. - Lebanese beignet - delicious! Very very sweet, if that\\'s what you like. I\\'d recommend eating this right away, as I waited a while before eating mine & it had cooled & hardened a bit. - Ilili candy bar - if you like heavy, dense, rich chocolate desserts, this is the one for you. There\\'s a crunch layer on the bottom of the candy bar which adds really well to the smooth texture of the chocolate, & it\\'s even more rich dipped in the chocolate sauce on the side. POSITIVES: - Food was delicious, well cooked & seasoned (except for slightly burnt chicken).Excellent variety in the menu. - great portions! Great for sharing. - Waitress was good at explaining the menu & how the restaurant worked/ how to eat certain things. NEGATIVES: - service was slow (despite our specific request to be out of there at a certain time) & our waitress was MIA for a lot of the dinner.

I was really disappointed in the menu. It may just be that my tastes aren't as sophisticated as the Yankees up here, but I couldn't find anything that sounded good. I ended up ordering what the waiter suggested, it was a pounded out breaded piece of veal. My dad had the same and everybody else had a pasta dish. As an appetizer we had the bruschetta, which was good. It took a little while for the food to come out. The guys helping the waiters were very, very attentive. I don't think I ever had to wait on somebody to fill my glass with water, and I probably drank 6 glasses or better. When the food arrived, I was amazed by how small the portions were. Then I was further amazed how bad the veal was. I take that back, it wasn't bad, but it was a disgrace to how veal should be prepared. It tasted dead up like a country fried steak. We all left hungry and disappointed. And to top it all off, it's cash only.\",\n",

       " \"Our experience at Pok Pok was exceptional on all levels. \\xa0 FOOD IS AMAZING... not just one dish... every dish. \\xa0I spent a month in Northern Thailand, and it's tru Pok Pok is the closest I've ever come to authentic Northern Thai (or any real Thai for that matter), in NYC. Granted it was a Monday night, so we didn't have the 90-minute weekend wait (though we still had a 30-minute wait, we were sent to the Whiskey Soda Lounge and thoughtfully watched over with drinks until our table was ready). Service was incredibly quick and attentive. \\xa0Our server made great recommendations on the number of dishes and types of dishes to order, to provide us with a variety of tastylisciousness without overplumping our bellies. The Catfish is a MUST. \\xa0The Chang Mai sausage is a MUST. \\xa0Both these dishes capture the fresh & fragrant, lemony-minty-chili-ness of real Thai food. \\xa0We also had the pork shoulder-pork belly and it was fantastic... deep, rich sauce filled with complex layers of spices that unfold in your mouth. \\xa0Even the broccoli and mushrooms, while simple, were the perfect off-set to the spicier dishes, with a subtle but exciting flavor. I immediately wanted to return the next day, for another meal. TIPS for a great meal at Pok Pok : 1. \\xa0Go early in the week, after they've spent Sunday recovering from the weekend rush. \\xa0They're re-stocked, and re-energized, and the wait is a fraction of the time. 2. \\xa0Ask your server what is particularly good THAT NIGHT. \\xa0This changes, it seems, from night to night, so just like ordering street food in Thailand, throw any cravings off your foodie boat, and go with the flow. 3. \\xa0Don't order similar dishes. \\xa0Make sure you get dishes with different flavor profiles, so you can taste how they compliment each other. \\xa0And don't shy away from subtle flavors... they enhance how the spicy ones hit your palette. 4. \\xa0Don't overindulge on whiskey before your meal!! \\xa0This will kill your tastebuds and anything spicy will seem to fall flat in your mouth, as you'll miss all the flavor layers. \\xa0 5. \\xa0Skip the dessert and opt for the Mango Coconut drink instead... heaven in a stainless martini glass. \\xa0The perfect finish.\",\n",
       " \"The clam pizza is a must order!!!! Order it half and half - one side with cheese and one side without. You won't regret it. I loved the cheese side more than non cheese. We split two small pizza three ways. My friend and I liked the clam one more and the hubby liked the margherita one more. Preference I suppose. I felt the margherita was a bit runny for my taste, but still good. The clam one was very unique and had a good amount of clam on it. The side w/o cheese was a bit runny, the side with the cheese wasn't. I like firm/ crispy crust so I favored the cheese side. :) Oh oh! Get the White Birch Soda! It tastes like a cream root beer but with less sugar (real sugar!) and no caffeine! :) YUM! I typically do not drink soda because I think they're bad for you, but I actually knew what all the ingredients were in this soda! Superb and friendly service.

       " \"Multiple times. Thursday Night (11pm dinner), Friday Night (6pm dinner reservation) Food: 85% ---- Charcuterie board - that chicken liver pate was really good, surprisingly. Bone Marrow Poppers - I really wanted to like this dish. It had the elements of a would-be awesome plate, but the bone marrow was masked texturally and flavor-wise by the puff pastry and the garnish on top. I really could not taste the bone marrow that much. Burger with Shoestring fries - basic, good greasy food. Lamb Chops - gamey, meaty, cooked perfectly. Steak Tartare - this is prepped tableside. Again, I wanted to like this dish but I've had better steak tartares where the actual flavor of the meat just exudes from the dish. I think EO's interpretation is still good but depending on what type of spices you're in to, this dish may be playing with a little bit too much aromatics. There's spice, tanginess, slight bitterness, and then gaminess from the meat. Drinks: ---- Mata Hari - really good cocktail. Ambre Cognac. Tangy, slightly sweet, with striking aromatics. Ready Fire Aim - Mezcal. Smoky, pineapple flavor cocktail with a kick of habanero bitters. This drink is amazing. (not so for non-mezcal drinkers who feel like drinking mezcal is like eating a cigar). Service: 90% ---- The front doorman is definitely a lot friendlier and less obnoxious than most doormen at other speakeasy-type places (i.e. Death and Co, Pouring Ribbons). Even if EO has its own following and is quite known, it does not exude elitism. The servers were very friendly and very accommodating. Ambience: 100% ---- Dark, animated, high noise level but still comfortable, casual to classy. Value: 90% ---- I haven't tried the all food items, but the steak tartare has definitely garnered some praise so it is a very subjective dish. Reservations I think are only for dinner goers so if you simply want a cocktail, you might have to wait a bit. I would recommend at least trying out their food once, and if you don't fancy the flavor profile, then for sure come back for the cocktails.\",\n",

On the flip side: The space is extremely cramped. You will not be able to eat here in peace for lunch. Also, the wait is incredibly long around lunch time.

The décor makes you feel like you've been transplanted into historic Europe.

Whether you are seated at a table or a booth, be prepared for an intimate experience where you will barely be separated from adjacent guests - you will literally be rubbing elbows! Also, the vibrant energy created by the hustle and bustle of the waiters and guests and the sound of people sharing conversations can be overwhelming, but for me it was a wonderfully cosmopolitan experience. And the food! Ooh la la~ The last meal I had there was a lazy Saturday afternoon brunch with my wife so I had the Eggs Norwegian and she had the scrambled eggs in puff pastry... or was it the other way around? No matter, because we were both indulging in one another's dishes the way fat kids eat cake. The Eggs Norwegian featured perfectly cooked poached eggs with smoked salmon and hollandaise sauce and the scrambled eggs in puff pastry came with wild mushrooms and asparagus. At the end of our meal, we could feel our faces glowing the way faces allegedly glow after sex... or was it simply the French butter oozing out of us? Regardless, the meal was that orgasmic. Aside from their brunch, their bakery with French pastries is amazing, and their dinner entrees, especially my favorite, moules (mussels) and frites are heavenly.

My favorite restaurant of all time (OF ALL TIME) is Les Halles, and my last meal would have to be their coq au vin, so when I glanced at the menu, I knew I had to try theirs to size it up. Ordered - Coq au vin, Chatelaine to drink. Date had the Macaroni au Gratin. We split a cheese plate of the goat\\'s cheese they had at the time. Service - Our waitress was super nice and super French (aww, she called us \"monsieur-dame\", my heart is warmed!), and I thought the entire staff went out of the way to help us. So much so that it got a tiny bit annoying that they would refill our water glasses if we took even two sips from them so we would have to stop our conversation. Not a big deal, though - I appreciated the enthusiasm. Ambiance - REALLY cozy, dimly lit, very romantic, but casual all at once. The back room is gorgeous! Another reviewer said they had their wedding there, and I can see why! Perfect for a private function. I had my cocktail, the Chatelaine, and was in cocktail heaven. Gin, white wine, pomegranate juice, and elderflower extract, served in a champagne glass. Magnificent! Rivals some of the drinks at Flatiron Lounge, my favorite cocktail joint. We got the cheese plate, which was nice and only $4. The chevre was a bit intense for what I\\'m used to, but it was marbled, and I wasn\\'t quite expecting that. I\\'m no cheese snob, anyway. I just like goat\\'s milk cheese. The macaroni and cheese was the bomb dot com! I would only improve on it by maybe cutting the amount of breadcrumbs on top in half. The coq au vin was nothing like what I order at Les Halles, but that wasn\\'t really a *bad* thing, so to speak. The sauce it was cooked in had a flavor that sort of tricked your brain in to thinking you were eating a pot roast, but the meat fell off the bone with the slightest touch of a fork, and the mashed potatoes on the side were AMAZING, even though I\\'m not a fan of mashed potatoes in general. The price is also super reasonable for what you get, so that\\'s great, too. I took off one star for the lack of credit cards being accepted at a restaurant that probably turns around $50 for a two-person dinner (come on, even the bodega around the corner takes Visa), and the aforementioned constant water pouring.

Since then I've gone back on many occasions, often with friends from the other boroughs - and all in all, I've enjoyed my brunches - until recently. A friend and I got delivery here from delivery.com the other day. Granted I ordered food at 11:30am on a weekend, it still should not have taken them 3 phone calls, and an 1 hour and 50 minutes to deliver a medium rare burger and a chicken sandwich. Furthermore, the food wasn't very good. While I've never been blown away by Sanford's in terms of their food - this was the worst quality I've experienced from them. My burger ($7) was waaaay overcooked and was on the flat side and the meat lacked any flavor. I've had better fast food hamburgers. My friend said her chicken sandwich was fine, but I think because she had to wait so long and was starving by the time the food arrived she didn't really care how it tasted. I noticed that they expanded their pre fixe brunch menu (the price has also increased to $14) - but really it just seems as if they threw in some more pancake and waffle options. As someone with a gluten allergy, it's a bit disappointing that they offer few gluten free friendly items. As such, unless they become a bit more food allergy friendly or speed up their delivery service, I don't see myself ordering in or dining out.\",\n",

Out of curiosity and a quest for a fabulously gayous scene for people watching, I went there with a coworker after we\\'d already had dinner at Momoya\\'s nearby - one of our mutually favorite sushi spots. On our way over, I saw a painted mural on the side of a building with children on it and the memorable theme words: \"We dream of becoming grown-ups who make a difference.\" It turned out to be a quiet night all around in Chelsea but the drinks were strong and we were happy to extend our girly girl talk here. After reading all the great reviews, and as an Thai food fanatic (preferably authentic), I\\'m bookmarking this on the \"must try\" list.',\n",
       " \"Whoa, Tony's! Definitely better the second time around! My first time here was with a birthday party of 15 or so. They definitely accommodate to groups with no problem. Most of them take up the downstairs. I was so lost and kinda overwhelmed by the # of people and quantity of food, that I couldn't pass a fair judgement on the place (remembering that the sangria and mussels were good). Our table had a white VS red sangria thing goin' on. Psh, I'd say us reds won, yo. Just came back for the 2nd time with few of my boys to celebrate Thanksgiving. \\xa0This time, we were seated upstairs and I got a good look at the place. It has really comfortable lighting and space. The decor was classy & cute with plenty of posters and caricature pictures. Our waitress, so sweet & charming :) Pitcher of sangria: has about 8 glasses. Strong but delicious! We really enjoyed this. Linguini w/ clam sauce: I personally loved it so much, I even ate the garlic. The pasta was cooked perfectly, the dish was LOADED with clam meat - it's a great alternative to your classic tomato or creamy sauces. Mussels Luciano: we chose the large order over the appetizer size, our waiters were teasing us about not being able to finish it... well we did! The sauce does wonders for the mussels and if you pour some over your pasta. Just try to eat them while it's hot cuz this dish does cool down fast. Sausages w/ peppers: sadly, the peppers outshone the sausages in this dish. The sausages barely had flavor, but the texture was good. Most of us were fighting over the roasted red peppers (usually refuses peppers). Very soft and sweet! Tonight's Special: Italian Cordon Bleu. The boys really loved this. Chicken breast stuffed with mozzarella and prosciutto, and Garlic Marsala sauce topped with mushrooms. Last but not least, a black & white chocolate mousse cake that was just the right amount of sweetness, split between us 4. This meal could NOT have been any better. Props to Tony's!\",\n",
       " \"This LA themed rock and roll taqueria/bar is correct in every way. In LA this would only be a four star establishment, but given this is a good example of the kind of place Manhattan sorely lacks AND it's done so well I have to go five stars here. The pork tacos and the fish tacos are winners, with the steak and lamb not far behind. Seriously, this place is a step up for Manhattan, and they're doing it without being precious or faux-upscale. Tacos are $2.50 to $3 each, beer comes in either bottles or cans and the background music features distorted electric guitars. Kudos. You can easily go out in this neighborhood and spend more for Mexican that's nowhere near this good. If you do you're a fool. These are the tacos you're looking for.\",\n",

As it turns out, they do a very good job, producing an interesting range of rolls (which seems to be what most people order when they order sushi in this part of the world). We ordered four rolls (Spicy Crispy Roll with Crab, Twin Roll, Out of Control Roll, an Dynamite Roll), together with a single piece of uni sushi, and it was all very good indeed. To my surprise, all the staff were speaking Mandarin with one another, so I ended up chatting with them, and sure enough they are all from China, but despite this the quality of their Japanese food should not be underestimated.',\n",

The restaurant is rather small though, but I guess that just adds to its charm! Upon sitting down, we were offered bruschetta, which I honestly really liked - not too sour, not too salty, not too garlicky. Amongst 3 people, we shared the fried calamari and sauteed mussels in tomato broth, which was more than enough for the 3 of us to split. The calamari was good, but it was nothing to write home about - then again, what can I really expect from ordering fried calamari? The mussels were good and the tomato broth was light enough to not overpower the mussels but still provide a good amount of flavor. For my entree, I ordered the lobster crepes and it was DELICIOUS! The dish was presented in an adorable manner (2 crepe pouches tied with...chive?) and the tomato chive velute sauce really helped make the dish stand out. And there was actually a lot more lobster confit within the crepes than I initially expected - I was pleasantly surprised to find large chunks of lobster within almost every bite! By the end of the dinner, I was completely stuffed so I didn't have any dessert. But instead of dessert, we got another sweet treat - the bill was surprisingly low! For the amount and quality of food we had, our bill could have easily surpassed what it really was (about $40 per person, with tax and tip), but I guess that's what makes this place such a gem. I would definitely recommend Basso56!\",\n",

He was very enthusiastic and committed to it over email and then I stopped by the bar to introduce myself. I promoted the happy hour(s) and fundraiser to everyone and brought a rather large group that evening after work. We had a nice table in the corner near the window. The other people stood near the bar and we had a nice time ordering both food and drinks. People weren't shy to order more because they knew that a percentage was going to charity. Jaime and I had agreed to take a look at the final amount of the bill at the end of the night and he would donate a percentage based on the amount. At the end of the night, he was no where to be found and the bartender advised that he left for the night. \\xa0I emailed, called, and stopped in a few days later but he stayed out of sight and dodged my emails and calls.

If you are daring, read on. If you\\'re REALLY daring, try going there. Okay, we are falafel connoisseurs... not experts or snobs, but we like our falafel, and my (now-ex) girlfriend is even quite picky about it. So on our trip to NYC, we sought out the best falafel. And let me tell you, Mamoun\\'s was the exact opposite of it. We got lucky by only having a short line; the positives ended there. The falafel sandwich there consisted of a pita filled with hummus, falafel, and other ingredients. To start with, the pita was nothing special-- their pitas are fresh, if you consider that to mean \"fresh off the truck from the distributor.\" They had 50 bags of pitas, the same kind you get at the supermarket, they\\'d rip open a bag and you hope that you don\\'t get a dry one. For allegedly being \"the best\", I\\'d expect more... this is the food capital of the world, they\\'ve got to be able to get better pita. GRADE: \\xa0C MINUS. The hummus was pasty, and chalky, yet was still really watery. NO THANKS, I like my hummus nice and spreadable and with a pleasing flavor. Again: pasty and CHALKY. And runny. Bring your soup spoon. GRADE: F. The falafel ball itself: UTTERLY DEVOID OF TASTE. Are you kidding me? This place is \"the best\"? The falafel seriously had zero taste. The texture was okay, and it wasn\\'t too oily, but I would hope for some actual FLAVOR. It had no kick or spice AT ALL. Your average falafel at any other place in the city will have more flavor. GRADE: D. Other ingredients in the falafel sandwich: iceberg lettuce, pre-chopped in the bag, and diced tomatoes. Gee, thanks-- anything else that they can get in bulk for pennies, just to make you feel like you\\'re getting a full sandwich? GRADE: \\xa0C MINUS Other foods: the other thing we tried there was the tabouleh. \"They can\\'t mess THIS up,\" I thought. But I was wrong. It had minimal bulgur-- which is a key component-- really, almost none at all! And the parsley-- the other key component-- was minimal too. Their \"tabouleh\" was basically chopped cucumbers with a bit of parsley. GRADE: D. Atmosphere: that is putting it nicely. We were lucky-- or unlucky-- enough to get the booth right there. The interior is dingy and dirty. It made us want to eat quickly and get out... which, come to think of it, is what they might want. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Were we there on an off-day? Well if you\\'d like a second opinion, my sister agrees with me. I mentioned my Mamoun\\'s experience to her, and it turned out that she and her husband had eaten there on a trip several months earlier-- also while questing for \"the best falafel\". She had the same complaints, but with one additional one: they gave her a can of Coca-Cola that had a layer of dust and \"something mysterious crawling on it.\" With that in mind, I\\'ll give the atmosphere/interior a grade of D MINUS. If you are looking for falafel in NYC, please look elsewhere-- keep an open mind and don\\'t buy the hype. Chickpea\\'s was good (though still nothing special.) The place across the street from Mamoun\\'s-- I don\\'t remember the name-- was MUCH better for everything we ate. Give that one a try-- their falafel sandwich was tasty and much more enjoyable, and the staff was nicer, and wasn\\'t trying to hurry you out. I am really just a person who likes falafel, and went to Mamoun\\'s hoping for the best, but instead I was HORRIBLY DISAPPOINTED. I\\'ve tried to be very descriptive with my criticisms here. So let\\'s look at all these grades above. C-, F, D, C-, D, D-. This works out to a \"GPA\" (for \"Grossly Putrid Adventure\") of 1.01. Any way you look at it, that\\'s a solid F. Sorry, Mamoun\\'s, but I\\'m here to tell people that the emperor wears no clothes. (Incidentally, best falafel we\\'ve had is at Truly Mediterranean in SF CA) (Update 4/08 to add: I haven\\'t been to Azuri Cafe in Manhattan, but Yelp reviews indicate that their falafel is about the best around. TRY THERE! \\xa0Whenever I go to NYC next I\\'ll try Mamoun\\'s again just for a second data point, but only after I get a tetanus shot.)',\n",

       " \"My husband & I just finished eating here. After reading all the good reviews, and BBQ being one of my favorite food, we had to drive down to Red Hook, and check it out. When we first walked in, we were both a little confused on the ordering system, one of the owners came right over, and explained everything to us, he was extremely nice, giving us a brief disruption, showing us the place, and making small talk. I am all about customer service! And this place has it! You can tell right off the bat that they care about their restaurant, and the customers, this you don't see so often anymore. Especially in such a large establishment. Ok on to the food....the ordering system is basically standing on line, ordering your meat first (we had the pulled pork, brisket & wings) they cut the meat right in front of you, give you the amount appropriate for you, and weight it. Then you order the sides (we got macaroni & cheese, potato salad, and baked beans) after that you pay, get your utensils, and sit down. Basically cafeteria style, reminded me of high school. The drinks even soda you have to order from the bar. I've been to other places with this style of ordering, it doesn't bother me, except the fact I had to go to the bar for soda, and keep getting up for drinks. It would have been nice if someone would at least take drink orders. But other then that which isn't much, doesn't make me dislike the place. The pulled pork was delicious, so was the brisket, the macaroni & cheese had a good kick to it, I don't know what was in it, but it was a little spicy. Would I order it again? Hell yes! So was the potato salad! While eating another owner came over and asked how the food went, great guy! Funny personality, explained that the wood on one of the walls came from a hundred year old barn that was destroyed after hurricane sandy, thought it was nice to speak to us, and many of the other people eating. I've ate at a lot of BBQ places in Brooklyn, and this one is one of the BEST! It has a unique taste, but a very delicious one!

I thought that maybe Lombardi's or Grimaldi's or some other pizza joint I've been to in my lifetime would be better, but I was blown away by the product from this pizza parlor. I mean, for this review it's not about being authentic or original. It's just about being good/memorable and the last meal I would request if I was on death row. I don't want to to get into gastronomy, organic, or processing arguments, but trust me about this one being very high on your favorite pizza list if not number 1. You must absolutely try this joint when you're in NYC. I try my best to take things with a grain of salt. So just because this pizza place has the most reviews on Yelp, doesn't necessarily mean it's that good. Well, I think that this is one of those times. On your bucket list, you must get a slice of Artichoke pizza at Artichoke Basille's Pizza. Oh, and they just opened one up in Berkeley, CA. I must try and compare.\",\n",
       " 'I felt it would be appropriate that my first \"official\" review should be the one place that I could consider my second home in Philadelphia. I will try to keep this review as unbiased as possible, but the positive experiences I\\'ve had here has made it a very difficult task. I\\'ve been coming to PYT pretty much since it opened. And like most restaurants starting off, it had its share of inconsistencies and faults at first. The service was not the best, my burgers were not always cooked correctly and they were still trying to figure out who they were catering to. The reason I hold this place in such high regard is because I was currently the \\'new kid\\' in the area when this place opened. So essentially we were both trying to figure out what the hell we were doing at the time. Over the past year I\\'ve been coming here and every time I visit I feel more and more welcome. The current staff are some of the nicest and hardest working people I\\'ve met. They\\'re friendly to the point where I feel like I am part of the PYT family. Another amazing quality that this place has is that the owner, Tommy Up is there almost all the time just hanging out and talking to the patrons. He makes it a habit to get to know every single person that comes here and makes sure they are enjoying themselves. Now onto the food: I\\'ve pretty much tried every burger they have on the menu as well as almost every burger of the week... the fact that I don\\'t weigh 300lbs at this point is somewhat of a mystery to me. Regardless, I have never been disappointed by a single burger I\\'ve had. There have been some that I\\'ve liked WAY more than others but every single one of them has had their merits and I\\'ve never had a time where I regretted ordering something (aside from the time I thought it would be a good idea to put two patties of beef on the cheese steak pretzel roll burger.. but that was my own damn fault.) The adult milkshakes are something that I\\'ve ordered all too frequently as well. The Diplo Shake (Key Lime Pie) and the Creamsicle Shake being two of my favorites. The Monkey Julius (One Part Golden Monkey/One Part Orange Juice with a splash of Champagne) has pretty much become a staple drink for every time I\\'m there. I\\'ve also introduced this to a few of my friends who simply have responded \"wow...\" after trying it. Needless to say I\\'ve had one too many of these before. If you\\'re looking to party I\\'d suggest going here on a Friday or Saturday night. They tend to have the largest crowds and the best music selection as far as dancing. Hell, even Sunday brunch has become somewhat of a rager (probably due to the complimentary mimosas they serve from 12-2). If you\\'re looking for a more relaxed atmosphere for a date or just trying to get a bite to eat with some friends, I\\'d suggest going here anytime before 9PM during the week. It\\'s a little quieter and you can usually grab a seat quicker. Also be sure to \"check-in\" on foursquare because they have free drink specials going on all the time. Personally I think foursquare should thank PYT considering the amount of people I know personally who have downloaded that app specifically just to get their drink specials. Another few random/awesome things that occur here: - Doggy Ice Cream in the summer - Outdoor Waterbed - Heated Tent Lounge in the winter - 2 Separate rooms for dancing with different DJ\\'s spinning in each space - Don\\'t even get me started on Four Loko The reason I give 5 stars is because I\\'ve seen this place change and evolve into something completely original to Philly. They\\'ve overcome all the haters and skeptics that didn\\'t think it would even make it 6 months. You can\\'t compare it to anywhere else in the city and I\\'m sure there will be more than one place that will try to replicate what PYT has done. I could honestly write another few pages about this place but I think you should just go there for yourself and experience it. It\\'s definitely not for everybody, but they\\'ve established themselves as one of the hippest spots to visit and for that, you should at least give it a try.',\n",

THE STORY: Mehek is the best choice for Indian food in Princeton if price and convenience are your biggest motivating factors, otherwise the quality of food will leave you feeling (and smelling) a little oily. The masalas also tend to lack a bit of spice, as if Mehek were trying to occupy the most neutral territory in their buffet flavors. Even the Garlic Naan begs for more garlic, a shock since almost everyone can smell the Mehek kitchen from the street. The dining room is crowded with tables, even though reservations aren't generally needed for any lunch or dinner. The atmosphere ends up feeling a bit like you've been relegated to the kiddie table at Thanksgiving, since service runs a bit slow as well.

And the size! It is about a slice and half by normal pizza slice sizes which makes the $4 pricetag a little more palatable. The can of rolling rock was also delightful.

You get two cobs of corn per order. For my entree, I ordered the skirt steak with huevos ranchero. The steak was good. It was tender, and was indeed medium rare as I requested, but it wasn't as exciting as I expected my steak to be. Maybe the standard was set so high since I had previously eaten at Chez Jacqueline's the night before (whose steak is amazing there!!!). The inside was still tender and juicy, though. The rice and eggs were amazng! I loved the spices and seasoning they added to the rice. I gobbled the rice up quick! You also get some black beans with your order.

(And if anyone needs a place to loiter without questions asked, come here!) We picked our seating outside, and 20 minutes later, after several attempts of requesting staff to get our server, she finally turns up. We were handed these handwritten, oversized Serendipity-like menus. (Note: their specials e.g. kale gnocci is listed on a board in the front, so make sure you glance at it BEFORE you come in.) Pasta entrees ranged from about $11-26 and they also had \"Supper Specials\" for each day of the week. When I asked her about certain Italian terms I wasn\\'t familiar with, she wasn\\'t particularly good at hiding her annoyance that I wasn\\'t fluent in Italian. My sister seemed to enjoy her fennel, I mean, mushroom salad. And my $16 Tagliatelle al Ragu Bolognese was pretty tasty (1 star for that), but my homemade pomegranate iced tea tasted just like Starbucks\\' iced teas, but twice the price. My friends ordered the veal meatballs and the $11 spaghetti al limone, which they decided to mix together to give it more flavor. The lemon spaghetti tasted exactly like how it sounds; if you know how to cook pasta, squeeze lemons, and toss in parmesan cheese, it\\'s not worth it for you. I didn\\'t get a good look of the inside, so I can\\'t attest to the cozy atmosphere, but I surely will not come back nor recommend this place to anyone. ***CASH ONLY***',\n",
       " 'Oh... Oh My. My brunch world just got turned upside down. So, you can go and wait 1.5 hours down the street at Honey\\'s (not that there\\'s anything wrong with that), or you can stroll by all of the throngs of 20-30 somethings and take a seat in a seriously charming little French bistro. Not saying there was no wait at all, but with a super small dining area, there were really no more than a handful of people waiting at any one time during prime brunch hours on Sunday morning. The walls have adorable wallpaper accented with a black chair rail and ornately framed paintings of the owners dog (who, I am told, is frequently present in the cafe). There are little high top black tables, small marble tiles on the floor, and sweet French-countryside-esque banquets holding coffee accoutrements, water pitchers, and the sweet handmade, eclectic coffee mugs which serve your perfectly brewed La Colombe roast. On one end of the bar, logically, the end facing the large glass windows overlooking 4th St, you\\'ll find homemade pastries and cookies in little glass domes: shortbread cookies, baklava, rugelach, and something chocolate that I probably should\\'ve bought so I could figure out what it was. They don\\'t make the croissants in house, but it doesn\\'t really matter--they are perfect. The couple that owns this place is there waiting on you hand and foot. They are kind, attentive, and make you feel like family. They\\'ll stop by frequently enough that you are never left needing anything. Also, they are super kind to their regulars. When you sit, you are handed a small clipboard with the daily specials, which includes about 6-8 different plates. This is in addition to the very expansive French-Mediterranean choices that are regulars, written on the mirrored board above the bar. The options, as mentioned, are a good mix of classic French food with some Mediterranean flavors thrown in for good measure. I am told the food is French-Lebanese. I had an open faced sandwich called the \"N-Liberties,\" two english muffins topped with hummus, avocado, fried jalapenos, caramelized onions, crumbled sausage, all topped with a fried egg. Oh and with potato pancakes on the side as well. It was absolutely to die for. My dining partners finished most every bite on their plate--a croque madame made to order with scrambled eggs instead of over easy (they will accommodate every request), and a Mediterranean open faced burrito the size of my face. I love this place. I wanna come back every weekend. Actually, I wanna quit working normal day hours so that I can become a regular and just chill out with a perfect coffee, and a perfect pastry while doing whatever it is people do while sitting all day in coffee shops. Yeah, until now, I never wanted to be those people. This place makes me want to sit inside it all the time and become those people.',\n",

The staff seem to be changing a lot, and have run the gamut from incredibly polite to downright rude. During my last visit, the shop experienced a brief power outage, and the cashier seemed quite exasperated when we made a (very reasonable) request to cancel an order of cheese fries due to their inability to cook them. I asked for a cup of water, and she made it seem like the biggest hassle. And while another girl was ringing up our order, she basically shoved the tip can in front of me and gave me a look (no way!). On the other hand, the gentleman working at the store (perhaps the owner?) was incredibly nice and offered to make the cheese fries as soon as the power returned, without our asking!

It's all about the bubbling, oily and semi-heart attack causing cheese that is the game changer here folks. A slice of pizza and a cold Pepsi is seriously the best pair that Heaven ever created. I love that the crust is thin, but not floppy. Ugh, I hate floppy pizza. People have complained about the lines, but honestly that is when you know a pizza place is good! There is definitely no shortage of great pizza spots in NY, but I don't know what it is about G's that has me dying to come back for more. Another great thing is the price.

       " \"Chicken fingers are designed to be good. \\xa0They arrive at restaurants, pre-cut and pre-breaded, ready for the fryer. Six to eight minutes later, they're on the table, with a small plastic dish of sweet barbecue or honey mustard sauce and a pint of beer. Sticky's isn't satisfied with a good finger. Here the goal is a great dish and that's required rethinking the whole chicken finger experience. First they've chucked out almost the entirety of the traditional bar menu - fingers are the focus here and they come in many different varieties. The sauces here are not just side dishes, they are built into the dish itself. The General Tso's tender comes marinated in chili, soy and honey sauce that's wet enough to require a fork. Three tenders is a full meal. The tender itself is a piece of perfection - the coating flaky and crunchy. More importantly the inside is moist and flavorful, not dried out like those frozen bar tenders. For now, Sticky's one location is tiny, without much seating and a BYOB policy. With fingers this good, however, I imagine franchising will soon be a possibility if the owners desire. Get the perfect finger (at the soon-to-be) original location.\",\n",

The garlic wings, as many reviewers say, are the absolute must have. You can get them with any level of heat. Since they opened up their Boonton location I've stopped coming to Clifton as much, and would note the following in comparison: * Cheaper here by 10 cents per wing, 20 cents per clam. * Dive/neighborhood bar atmosphere, not open/airy * Much more mixed clientele, in terms of age, race, etc. * Louder - plus the music blaring from the jukebox - and MUCH more crowded. Good luck finding a place to sit. Service has gone downhill here - a lot of work to get the bartender's attention or to get anything corrected. I actually got attitude from the bartender last time when I was trying to pay and be on my way. My original 5-star rating dropped by 1 star when Boonton opened - like night and day, the two places - and now by another star because of my recent experiences.

It came with cole slaw, pickles and I ordered a free side order ( thx to Yelp) applewood smoked bacon and baked beans. The meat was ok, the meat was not as flavorful as I hoped. Coleslaw and pickles were good. Baked beans had no bacon applewood flavor. The beans were a bit hard. Had to cook a little bit more. Their special sauces ( spicy, sweet and Original) were nothing special. It was like a bit watery and sugary in my opinion. Food needs to improve I think. Service and store was very nice.

A place that can't deliver flavour on basic things, such as lasagña and a simple pizza with mushrooms can't be considered good under any standards. The mushroom pizza simply didn't have any taste apart from the bread which is good. The lasagña barely had meat and the meat it had was not seasoned. In general I think their biggest problem is the flat tomato sauce, something that was surprising given how fresh the vegetables they used looked. Still, I think it won't take much to fix these basic problems to provide good quality food.\",\n",

       " 'David Chang has referred to Ssäm Bar as the place that most closely delivers his ideal dining experience. What originally began in 2006 as a burrito bar has made the transformation into one of the premier restaurants serving large-format meals for groups. While it\\'s entirely possible to drop in on a whim and order a few small plates at the bar, coordinating a large-format meal is nothing short of an annoyance. It requires planning in advance and navigating Momofuku\\'s platform to secure a spot, and a finalized headcount 24 hours prior. A pain, yes, but I was hopeful that it would be worth the hassle. Our group had reserved the Bo Ssäm meal in advance, which features the signature pork shoulder. The restaurant also offers Rotisserie Duck and Dry Aged Rib Eye options as well, for those looking for alternative proteins, but the pork shoulder should be a go-to for any first time visitors. Once we were all seated, our server dropped by to give us a quick overview of the meal format and to address any questions we had. We started off with a tray of briney oysters, and our table was soon covered with a number of condiments and sides to complement the Bo Ssäm. There\\'s a basket of the Bibb lettuce, a bowl of white rice, and four sides/sauces: the addicting ginger-scallion, the sweet and spicy gochujang, the under-appreciated ssamjang (a spicy soybean paste), and the omnipresent cabbage kimchi. They\\'re all meant to highlight the star of the show: the slow-roasted pork shoulder. The protein is cooked for upwards of 6 hours, then layered in a mixture of salt and brown sugar before being blasted at full heat. The result is a masterpiece of a protein; a tender, fall-apart interior with a few surprising pockets of fattiness, and a crisp, almost carmelized, crust. Breaking into it with a pair of tongs is a momentous event, but there\\'s no need for pretense at a meal like this. There\\'s no \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to tackle a meal at Ssäm Bar, but guests are advised to start with the Bibb lettuce as the base, pile on a scoop of rice, and then layer the pork shoulder and additional sauces to their liking. Wrapping it with the lettuce before biting ensures as minimal mess as possible, but there\\'s bound to be some level of chaos as people reach for the different components and sides. Anywhere from 6 to 10 people are recommended for the Bo Ssäm meal, and while larger parties might want to add on a few small plates, our group walked away with several to-go boxes. I give Ssäm Bar three stars because while I did have a good meal, there\\'s nothing particularly innovative or intricate about the food or the preparation required. It\\'s simply a matter of time and having the equipment necessary to slow-roast a pork shoulder for hours. The price point isn\\'t exactly wallet-friendly either, as one Bo Ssäm meal is $225, exclusive of tax and tip. For those looking to accommodate a large party, Momofuku Ssäm Bar is a viable option, but I don\\'t foresee a return visit in the near future.',\n",

If you are a germaphobe I would avoid, if you want an amazing slice of unique pizza give it a shot for a slice.

Reasons why this restaurant deserves 5 stars: 1. Italian boyfriend who chose this restaurant and cleaned his plate and mine (couldn't finish my tagliatelle w. ragu) 2. Italian boyfriend's friends are waiters here 3. Location Location Location !! 4. We're in a recession, yes... but this is a great value. So take your dates here! Recommendations: The spinach gnocci!!!! (Also, I saw my neighbor's spaghetti alla chitarra, chunky tomato marinara with cubes of gooey mozzarellas, it looked fantastic) Back to the gnocci.. I don't think you even need to chew. They literally melt in your mouth and I thought I knew what gnocci tasted like. I need to stop shopping at Wholefood's and buying that organic natural gnocci crap. Malatesta offers a hearty good portion for the same price and the views from the Hudson makes it a sure \\xa0hit.\",\n",
       " \"This is one of the few Filipino restaurants that I'll keep coming back to, only because Filipino home cooking is usually so much better. Filipino food isn't always the most attractive, but Jeepney does a great job at bringing Filipino food on a more appetizing plate. Everything here is pretty good, so I'd suggest just reading over the menu and pick what sounds good to you. If you like garlic, definitely get the garlic rice. When they get their liquor license back, it'll be even better because they had this white drink with hibiscus flower that was delicious! The staff here is great. The past few times, Kristin served me, and she's always super nice and helpful. Definitely make reservations if you plan to come here, just to be on the safe side. I've seen it get pretty crowded with waits around 30-45min around prime time.\",\n",
       " \"As I walked down Henry st last night, it was a peaceful atmosphere. Closed bakeries, an indie cinema, a quiet wine bar. And then, a crowd. There was no sign to clearly identify it, but I knew just by the presence of a crowd that we had arrived at none other than noodle pudding. The decor and ambience are simply pleasant. There's a lot of ppl so don't expect a quiet evening. So the first step you should take upon arrival is to walk past the line of ppl and find the host (who is one of the waiters) and give him your name, lest someone cuts you while you wait for the host to cone to you, a was what happened to me. Anyway, 20 min later my date and I were given the center table by the front window. Lucky. We could enjoy the breeze and people watch both patrons and passersby. Ok on to the food. $10 appetizers, pasta between $10-20 and main dishes more than $20. House wine was $14 a bottle and was delicious. The menu is heavy in Italian so I found myself googling a lot. Ended up getting the calamari for an appetizer and lasagna as my entrée. The calamari wasn't that good. That is a major downgrade for someplace with such a string reputation. Texture was fine but the taste was a bit off. And the sauce they gave was neither plentiful nor outstanding. As for the lasagna, it was a small portion, looked real good, but not enough sauce. Ok so bottom line. Initially I thought that the portions were small but more filling than they appeared. In hindsight, I attribute my fullness to inflammation. What is that, say you? It is basically when part of your body swells up, like your ankle when you sprain it. Well I basically had intestinal inflammation. How do I know? Because not only was I uncharacteristically full status post appetizer, but status post meal I had status diarrhea. Can I say with absolute certainty that it was the calamari or lasagna or noodle pudding period? No. But I did not eat much else for quite some time beforehand. +1 ambience +1 service (better than anticipated from reviews) +1 presentation -1 bang for buck +1 deliciously cheap house wine +1 variety -1 bad calamari (should be a staple) -1 diarrhea Sauce lovers will be disappointed. Cheese lovers will not be. Glad I went, but this place is way overhyped. Will rather go to a small joint or little Italy.\",\n",

It feels like you're in some underground bar circa 1943 and when the subway rumbles up above you, it helps to steep you even further in the warmth of the restaurant. It's dark inside and their are quirky little furnishings all over. They even have live music. I love that it's the size of a small apartment and they have live music. So so cool. The food? The food is pretty damn good too. I'm a big fan of their steamed artichoke. It's done perfectly - nice and tender, so juicy that when you bite into the it, the juice/broth always runs down my wrists and arms. The aioli that accompanies it is yummy too. I've had a few of the mains and I have to say that I prefer the starters, in general (the lentil salad is also great). One of the times I ordered the mussels they were quite shriveled up and I felt like it was because they weren't the highest quality of the freshest ever. I think it might best to order stuff other than seafood. The chicken is, well, chicken-y. I'd say it's a little on the dry side but still good. While the starters are good, they pale in comparison to the date cake. Wow. I'd say it's top ten favorite desserts I've ever eaten. Yes, it's that good. In short, go to Moto for the vibe, ambiance, starters, booze (beer and wine only) and the cake.\",\n",

Hubby had the turkey burger, which was charred beyond recognition. Fries were pretty good, but spicy coleslaw was nasty (limp, bland, definitely not spicy). \\xa0Good beer list, and I liked the slightly grungy, genuine-feeling ambience.

I can't complain too much though because once we got our food, it was fantastic. The schnitzel sandwich burst with flavor from the lingonberry aioli and had delightfully fluffy and soft bread. \\xa0I'm not usually a fan of bratwurst, but my mom's was delicious. We also got the pretzel appetizer which came with interesting spreads, but I would pass on it next time. This place seemed seriously understaffed with one waiter and one chef, so I would recommend them hiring more people.\",\n",

The slice is $4.75 but it was huggggggge. Of course I ate the whole thing. A girl's gotta eat, right? I haven tried any other types of pizza but they also looked great. The only reason why I gave four stars is because the seating arrangement sucks and by seating arrangement I mean lack there of. There are only seats outside but will happen in the winter?

Okay, so it may not be caviar or foie gras but there\\'s great pho and then there\\'s blowyourfuckingmind pho. Fortunately, Pho Ha cooks up the latter.

When you\\'re ready to order (one of the 15 pho variations along with possibly a summer roll and coffee w/ condensed milk), simply point to the menu and/or shout out the number found next to the most pleasing description of soup. Two and a half minutes later, your meal has arrived accompanied by a plate of sprouts, lime basil, hot peppers and lime that you may wish or may not wish to plop in your soup. Somewhere along your bench, you\\'ll find every condiment you\\'ll need, from sriracha and hoisin sauces to fish oil to some spicy pepper seed thingies immersed in oil.

From my memory, it's pickle carrot, cucumber and cilantro. No pepper. We don't have japaleno and we are not committing suicide by putting in thai chili pepper. There's also the option to add hot sauce if you crave heat. So I ordered the classic banh mi here. It's good, too much meat compared to the one I had in Vietnam, and too much carrot while cucumber or cilantro were barely present. I didn't like the spicy mayo, and glad that I had it on the side. It's a good meal, and good value. I don't think they are claiming to be the most authentic banh mi, and it tasted good. I would come back to try the rest of the menu.\",\n",

The inside of the garden room is perfect for occasions like this and just simply pleasing to the eye. Adds to the whole food experience in my opinion.

In fact, most of the drinks on the menu looked a little suspect to my admittedly picky palate, so I ended up just getting wine. We ordered satay and some rolls (egg rolls? spring rolls? who knows?), both of which were quite tasty but tiny (and therefore a bit overpriced).

The sea scallops tasted fresh and were full of flavor. The Salmon was harder to tell. They cook it to a \"medium\", but may be better served on the rarer side. The best part was the salmon was the little mushroom salad the Salmon was served on, absolutely esquisit. I know they focus on locally grown food, so the food may be even better come Fall. But, even in the winter they put together a great meal, and the ambience is a perfect remedy for the cold outside. My only complaint was that as we ate, I became extremely thirsty.

       " 'As I made my way down the dark, dingy alley and knocked three times on the door of Marrakesh, I thought to myself, \"I hope I live to see tomorrow.\" Alright, alright, I\\'m being dramatic but the first impression is that this place is a little sketchy. You have to knock on the door and are addressed in the doorway rather than your typical restaurant of walking in and chatting it up with the host/hostess. Thankfully my friend had a reservation for us so we were standing outside for only a couple of minutes before they sat us in an intimate booth. Almost positive if you do not have a reservation, you will be standing in the cold alleyway for a long time. When you sit down the waiter washes your hands in rosewater, drapes your lap in a towel and promptly opens up your BYO drinks. As soon as your first glass of wine is poured, you have the first course of many in the center of the table and it\\'s time to dig in. My first warning, if you do not like sharing food with others, you may want to reconsider this place for dinner. I\\'m pretty sure I indirectly swapped spit with my friends since I was licking my fingers and then grabbing for more food. Sorry friends! The first course was a plate of eggplant that was to-die-for and a cucumber/tomato salad. The waiters are constantly walking around with more pita so you never feel like you are out of \\xa0carbs. The second course and beyond were slightly a blur since I was already in a food coma but I\\'ll share what I can remember...there was a plate of couscous salad with raisins that was yummy, a whole chicken that was made \"spicy\" as well as a plate of lamb pieces. The food was beyond delicious though the meat was a tad dry but I still ate my face off. The only weird thing was before the baklava was served, the table was given a bowl of fruit. My only recommendation would be to have a fruit salad and maybe \\xa01/2 the portion for people to enjoy rather than eating an entire apple...seems a little wasteful. Overall, this place was amazing!!! Loved every moment of it and would highly recommend to anyone visiting Philly.',\n",

He is a very nice man who ran into some misfortune and is determined to get himself back on his feet through hard work. I think we can all respect that. As for the food, I am a huge fan of the #8 (kuey teo koke), #10 (chhar kuey teo koke), and the #15 (S.E.A. chhar kroeurng). I've had all of those dishes with chicken, which is delicious and moist. #8 and #10 are served with noodles. I particularly love the garlic and preserved cabbage in those dishes. I don't normally love rice dishes, but I liked the heat of #15. It could have been a bit spicier in my opinion, but still a great dish with its many vegetables and delicious flavors. Funny side note - there is no #9 on the menu. It jumps from #8 to #10. Also, I wish that he still served the #5 num pain saach. It's a Cambodian hero sandwich - I'm guessing similar to a Vietnamese banh mi. The owner said that it's too hard to make these sandwiches quickly without a bit of an assembly line of people so he took it off the menu. Too bad, but understandable.\",\n",

We started our eating adventure with the Cipolla pizza, my personal favorite. \\xa0An amazing blend of mozzarella, sweet Gorgonzola, caramelized onion, fresh rosemary, and topped with some prosciutto. \\xa0The balance was perfect. \\xa0PERFECT I tell you. \\xa0I\\'ve been dreaming of this pizza since Tuesday night when I went home happy/drunk. The follow up to the Cipolla turned out to be Aurore\\'s favorite: Smoked Pancetta pizza. \\xa0Another stellar one, this time with the aforementioned smoked Italian bacon, tomato, mozzarella, crimini mushrooms and black garlic. \\xa0That black garlic addition sets it apart from other pizzas and is the reason I can say with conviction that Toby\\'s knows what the fuck it is doing... Pardon my language, but typing this up makes me a little frustrated knowing that I\\'m back in Chicago and Toby\\'s is all the way in Brooklyn. \\xa0Don\\'t get me wrong, there are plenty of great pizza places here in The Chi, but there are very few that I\\'d ever consider going to knowing that hockey probably will be on TV. \\xa0For Toby\\'s I would.

Maybe not for the price awesome but if you had AMAZING service you wouldn't mind spending $$$ because your surroundings are so awesome as well. We couldn't get anyone to fill our wine glasses. No one really asked how our food was. No one made suggestions when we ordered or helped us with our experience. We disliked a dessert and no management or chef came to find out why. It was just like we were dining at any other restaurant. Which we clearly were not for the price tag. As others have written, our favorite part of the meal were the hot rolls they give you at some point. SO SO GOOD. If they do not give them to you during your meal for some reason, please beg for them. They will not disappoint. The cheese plate was solid and the person who delivered this did explain all the cheeses, thankfully. The table grabbed a few beginnings/pastas and the highlights by far were the heirloom tomato salad and the crab pasta. VERY good and very sharable. Our meals were all pretty good too. Everyone had something different from the meat to the fish. I would say if we returned we would stick to the smaller plates because they were a more creative spread and we had luck with the options. They definitely don't just cater to one specific taste profile which helped with an array of people with different dietary needs. Potentially my expectations were really high because I had been waiting so long to go but a 3.5 stars just made me sad.

I can never decide if a side piece with extra crust or a middle piece drenched in sauces is best.. so i just eat multiples of both! Obviously only been here for the pizza. Have been here just for take out slices to eat in, and with a group of 36. Take out- always hot and fresh Sicilian slices to take out immediately. 2.50/slice. CASH ONLY. Don't think they have an atm on premises. You can ask for middle and side pieces. Spumoni- delicious! has nuts so beware. With group-set menu: Salad was really fresh and tasty. Had Sicilian and \\xa0regular cheese pizza. Obviously Sicilian is waaaaaay better. i hate cheese pizza (where's the meat??) but better than most places and regular pizza crust is good. I love it when the cheese strings and the regular definitely did that. They have gluten free pasta options for those of you that can't partake in the pizza to cry into. Definitely worth the trek. and once you're done eating in, grab a box to go!

The space was large too and would be perfect for a private event. The wine list is impressive, our server was on point with the kind of wine I was in the mood for and ended up with the suggested Valpolicella, it was delicious and went so well with our meal! Next time I'm there, I'm definitely going to try the cocktails. We had the salt and pepper ribs, which were amazing and would highly recommend as an appetizer. They were seasoned perfectly and would go back for them again! We also had the wings, pizza and short rib. All dishes were cooked well! The only call out I have is that the area by the bathroom was a little cold but kept nice and clean.\",\n",
       " \"This is a very small Italian place just off Washington Square. What first drew me to it was a review I read somewhere, and I no longer ever remember what the review said exactly. I do remember the words: neighborhood, romantic, fireplaces, garden and warm. Those are all absolutely accurate, and I would never have found it if I wasn't looking for it. Me? I probably wouldn't go there for lunch. One, I don't have the time. Two, and more important this point is, this place is OK for lunch but that isn't where it really shines. It's dinner. How many quiet garden patios do you know of in NYC? Exactly. Better still, the bricks, great food, fireplace, small, warm....if it were me I wouldn't come here too often because that would make it a little less of a thing. At the same time, if there's any one whom your going out with - good friend, special friend, love, what have you - you can be reasonably certain that if you're interested enough to have read this review in the first place you're going to enjoy the company that much more in an atmosphere like this one. (the food wasn't bad either. quite good actually. and not overly expensive. I did see the prior review about the cockroach, by the way. Remember its NYC. They're like blue-collar Michelin stars. The best Indian restaurant I ever went to had a cockroach in it. They know what they're doing.)\",\n",

We started with 2 orders to share and I ordered another one towards the end as dessert :) -yeah, I was a happy camper!! Pond wings: Those were some gigantic frogs!!! Love the spicy dr. Pepper sauce with it-not too crazy with the cucumber relish? Grilled squid: It was my least favorite, only because I had better elsewhere. Nippon nachos: Dumplings are a bit tasteless on its on, but with the cheese and salsa-it was great. Love the creativity of this dish, using dumplings instead of nacho chips. Chicken waffles: Chicken is generally my least favorite protein, but this chicken I really liked it a lot!!! Maybe it was the jerk spice, or the tenderness and moist chicken, or the crispy waffles, or the blanched spinach, or the pineapple maple syrup--or maybe it was the combination of all that made me liked it so much!! (Actually, all of us liked it). Pork chop: I was skeptical when ordering this dish, only because not too many places can make it to be so tender and moist!! And with the Vietnamese inspired sauce, it was a great dish. However, the skin on the Vietnamese summer roll was too dry and chewy. Fish & chips: Almost every table had one, so how can we not? Fish was fresh and fried perfectly!!! I normally think it\\'s a waste to fry fresh fish since it does taste better steam or seared when fresh. (Fish is fresh because: a) the meat on it is not mushed, b) meat is not dried up, when fried-it\\'ll be like wood-y-ish). The yuzu salsa definitely lighten up this dish!! Another plus for creativity. Basa-nova: This dish was complimented, because it was mistakenly dropped on our table. Boy, it was the best mistake they made!!! We enjoyed the catfish so much. Meaty, firm but not tough. The fried chickpeas was excellent with the seaweed salad. Desserts: They don\\'t have desserts!! Which is fine by me. Don\\'t get me wrong, I love desserts and \\xa0I do have a sweet tooth. But it doesn\\'t seem like it\\'s their strong suit. So, I appreciate them not serving it than to push mediocre dessert and I\\'ll be disappointed. Service and staffs: Our server was great, considering she was a bit overwhelmed. She still manage to smile and comments. \\xa0And the rest of the staffs are very nice. Atmosphere: We sat outside, it was a great night to do so. Warm with cool breeze, tasty food with great companies. Can\\'t beat that!! Plus, the other customers are nice and friendly. Price: The price might be a bit much, especially for the neighborhood. But hey, all good things have a price.

Spanish Tavern's quality is unassuming from the outside. It was early evening and very quiet. We were warmly greeted by a wonderful staff. They brought out water and asked for drinks immediately. Their sangria is superb. The red sangria really reminded me of Spain. The complimentary soup, which was a nice surprise, was so fresh. The server brought out the entire metal pot and actually served it right on the table. I normally don't have soup at restaurants but this chicken/vegetable skinny noodle soup with freshly ground black pepper is making me reconsider. They also serve rolls, but I skipped out on those. I had one of the day's specials - seared salmon on a bed of broccoli rabe and lentils with a bit of tomato sauce. I never had broccoli rabe and salmon together, and i'd imagine having it with lentils even less. The three go unbelievably well together. My colleague had pork chops on the specials menu. It came with a little scoop of mashed potatoes. I tried some of that, too and my goodness, that's how you do a pork chop right - so juicy and flavorful. My other colleague had veal with Spanish Manchego cheese. She was the first one to be done and completely satisfied with her entire plate. The last meal on the table was Ternera Marbella, veal medallions with ham, peppers, and onions. They couldn't stop raving about that either. How often do you have 5 people unanimously impressed with all 5 dishes? The servers were so sweet and attentive.

My friend says he wants a table an hour from then. He\\'s told that they can\\'t make that promise. Why not?! My friend could\\'ve easily just sat his ass down and had a beer for the next hour.

When the place starts to get crowded, \\xa0he puts his name on the list and is told ther\\'es now a 30 minute wait. No big deal. Until they take 2 hours to sit us. This is for a group that was there about an hour beforehand. There is a completely unacceptable wait. During the wait, i see a number of comparable sized groups being seated before us, despite them coming in after us. We go and ask wants up after about 1.5 hours and we\\'re told that our group is too big and its hard to find a table that fits. I\\'m confused cause of those other groups and ask. Apparently they had increased out group size from 7 to 11 because \"some guy told us that your group got bigger\". That is NOT an acceptable excuse. Only increase the group size if the person who\\'s name is on the list says so. I could just go to the hostess and increase the size of every group in front of me until to get seated. Thats BS. After finally being seated, there is no communication between management and our waiter. After such a terrible experience, you would think we get attentive service. NOPE. We had to wait 30 minutes to take our order. The food takes over 45 minutes to come out, with two of the orders taking over an hour. You think after all the waiting, the food would atleast be cooked proper. NOPE AGAIN. All our burgers came out severely undercooked. Like there\\'s probably bacteria up in the shit.

       " \"Totto (Chicken Man) Ramen is a little hole in the wall place, like many ramen restaurants in Japan, and an affiliate of Hide-Chan across town. Totto is chicken broth oriented, but they have several varieties to choose from. I've had the regular, the spicy, and the meat lovers' ramen. Beware the meat lovers' (niku ramen)! It has, like, an entire pig in the bowl, which is also extra large, so you are unlikely to need kaedama. I couldn't even finish it all, which must be a first in my dining history. Niku Ramen is really tasty and satisfying, though. The broth just really warms the heart. It's off menu, so you have to ask for it. $15. The other options are fine, too, though I prefer Hide-chan a little bit. At both places, you will probably find the ramen palette-killing salty, as it is traditionally served in the States. Unfortunately, going there requires a trek to the East side. There is almost always a line and a sign-up list at Totto, so you are likely going to wait. If you show up alone, you have a better chance at quickly getting a seat at the bar. Otherwise, be prepared to endure the retarded (literally) new New York dining ritual. I had lunch here yesterday and had to listen to the two guys next to me enthusing about how great the ramen is. I think they wanted to suck the chef's cock, they were carrying on about it so much. So that's a positive review for you. As far as I can tell, the ramen here is totally fine, but it's never going to satisfy a ramen purist who's been to Japan. But nothing can satisfy them. Comparisons to Ippudo, I should add, miss the point entirely.\",\n",
       " 'Dear El Rey, I want to love you, I really do. You are so close and convenient. And so unpretentious! When you first took over the location of the old Midtown Diner, I barely even noticed you - then when I noticed your signage, I thought you were some sketchy taco place. Who knew you were a Starr restaurant, with your sneaky gold-marbled bar and diner decor? The first time we met, you worked hard to impress me. Your salsa was spicy, your tortilla chips plentiful - although I wondered why Starr couldn\\'t forgo the $3 and comp some tortilla chips, which seems pretty standard for a classier place. I ate skirt steak tacos, and they were delicious. By this time I knew you were a Starr place, and I was surprisingly pleased by their $9 cost. Throw in some Jarritos and horchata and I was looking forward to building an ongoing relationship. Since then, El Rey, our life together has been a series of minor disappointments. Nothing so egregious that it would cause me to leave you. Some of this comes down to my dislike of beans - I know, a dangerous trait to have in a Mexican restaurant. When I asked what came on the tostada, no mention of of beans - when my plate arrives, there are beans. So sad. Then this week, you put beans on my skirt steak tacos! Having ordered them 3 or 4 times now, I can tell you with authority that such a travesty has never occurred before. Finally, the \"Los Moles\" was a disappointment. The sauces were bland, nothing really seemed to click together. I overheard the staff and it sounded like someone may have been cooking who did not usually do so - but I\\'m not very tempted to order it again to find out if the regular staff does it better. That said, we have had some good times. Your esquites is incredible - buttery, a little spicy, absolutely delicious. Your service is always friendly and quick, and I\\'ve always been able to get a seat at the bar or a table without a wait. We\\'re not perfect for each other, El Rey. You disappoint me more often than I\\'d like, and our good times are pretty mediocre. But you don\\'t cost me much, and you\\'re just so easy and convenient.

       " 'We have been watching this space since the deli closed years ago and were so glad to see a restaurant opening a block away. We tried it last night and can only say that I hope it gets better. ATMOSPHERE It\\'s pretty. The restaurant has great lighting and the decor is very understated warmth but it\\'s a bit tight. The bar and open kitchen take up about 1/3 of the width, which isn\\'t that big to start, so tables are close together and the walk to the single bathroom located in the back is narrow with bar patrons, servers and runners and diners all trying to get through. Also, some patrons are obviously confused by the hard-to-pull chain on the old-fashioned toilet as both times we went in, it wasn\\'t flushed. FOOD Food was ok but nothing to shout about. My lentil, arugula and goat cheese salad was excellent. I wasn\\'t that impressed with the steak - it was unseasoned and a bit tough -- came presented on a plate with a pile of mashed potatoes and no sauces offered. Didn\\'t try any of the sides. We ordered the corn empanadas and ravioli for our 9-year old and she wouldn\\'t eat either of them. The empanadas were way too cheesy and the ricotta/mushroom ravioli were a bit sweet - didn\\'t get any flavor from the mushrooms at all. (Note: a friend who had been the day before raved about the spinach empanadas though). Our friend\\'s calamari were undercooked so the dough was pasty and tasted of flour. She gave one to the man celebrating his birthday at the next table, 10\" away, and he agreed. My husband liked his chicken Milanese and the fries were excellent - cooked to a crisp perfectly in oil infused with herbs, rosemary perhaps. For dessert, panqueques dulce de leche were tops and what kid doesn\\'t love chocolate gelato? Mine does, especially three scoops piled high. I found there are no small portions on the menu -- smallest steak is 12 ounces and the salad was enough for the table. SERVICE We were seated fairly quickly and the staff moved a table to accommodate us at the peak of the dinner rush. Our orders were taken and drinks arrived promptly followed not too long by bread with olive oil and then our appetizers/salads. And then it slowed down considerably. It took a very long time to get our main courses after they\\'d cleared the first course plates. The table seated next to us, and about 10 minutes after us, \\xa0finished their full meal, paid and were out the door before we ordered dessert. \\xa0Service felt rushed and uneven as if they just couldn\\'t handle the volume. Overall, it wasn\\'t a bad meal but I suppose a steak house where the salad and dessert were the best courses isn\\'t quite cutting it. They obviously have some glitches to work out with the food and service and I am hoping sincerely that they do because the potential is there and it\\'s sooooooo close.',\n",

Highlights from the meal: Food arrived very quickly! All the pasta dishes were very authentic (everyone enjoyed their meal) Things that can be improved: The air conditioning situation (In their defense it was during the middle of heat wave on one of the hottest days of the year, but they only have one ac unit and a ceiling fan for the entire restaurant. We were also right by the door.) Our waiter was condescending and patronizing at times I definitely need to come back when it is nice weather and even try out the patio. Since we were eating hot food in a hot restaurant we were somewhat uncomfortable, but we can't penalize the restaurant for the weather. But the conditions didn't make for the best dining experience.

The burrata was incredible, they also had a special of fried oysters that night with aioli and fennel and MAN that was good. We also got a small tasting of the pork tacos which were to die for.

Instead, we scored the last table that looked out onto the street...I felt like a window display. The bread and dipping sauce was great. A different take on bread and olive oil. The olive oil had tomatoes, garlic and some other ingredients...very tasty. I actually ate more bread than my entree. The bf and I ordered 2 items off the specials list. I got a veal pasta dish ($16) and he got a meatball and sausage pasta dish ($16). Unfortunately, I didn't really like my dish. Seemed more of a veal stew with pasta than anything and although the veal was tender, it tasty dry (is that possible?). My bf's dish was good...the sausages and meatballs were very tasty and definitely homemade as well as the pasta...I think since the shapes of our pasta looked man-made and each piece of pasta was unique in that snowflake-type of way. Service was exceptional and the overall feel of the place is romantic and very quaint. I LOVED the back seating area which looked like it was set-up for a dinner party.

       " 'My GF kept talking about this place. Inciting a Saturday outing to Bushwick, and convincing me, that Roberta\\'s would be the star attraction. First thing you notice about this place, is how incredibly hip it is. The people, and the clothes, make Portlandia look conservative. Tight rolled up jeans, canvass sneakers, and cool facial hair abound. Plus half the guys have wonderfully coiffed hair dues, so I blended in perfectly. We arrived at 4:00 PM, with a rotating amount of people who would be joining us for dinner. My friend was starving, so we decided to wait in the backyard, which was super chill. I had the frozen gin and juice, which was priced a little high, but gave me a nice buzz, so maybe priced just right. My GF had the iced coffee, which was flavored with Chicory, and tasted quite simply divine. We ordered two small appetizer pizzas. You can only order from the appetizer menu while sitting in the garden area, so if you are hungry, this won\\'t do the trick. The two small pizzas were quite good. Especially the small Margarita one. The spicey olive oil they use gives the pizza the perfect level of zest. Just spicy enough to have a kick, but not so hot that it is uncomfortable even for a sensitive palate. (I really would have liked to try some of the other appetizers here, like the bacon cauliflower). While we were in the backyard, taking in splendid views of young hip loft spaces, a wedding was happening, right next to us, in the fenced off garden. Mid way through my first drink, a lovely \\xa0bride, was standing right next to me, waiting for the moment where she would enter the garden and make her wedding vows. We also got to see the newly married couple exit and hug before going back. Apparently there is an event garden, which is also where Robertas gets some of their ingredients. So far, so cool. My GF was right, this place gets and A for ambiance, and is a great place to laze away a Saturday in Bushwick. (Favorite quote from nearby building, \"God loves side boob.\") So why am I giving this place 3 stars, and why are you reading this review? WELL THE FOOD silly. The food was good, but underwhelming. I tried 3 different pizzas, and the crust was delicious, but over charred, and tasted slightly burnt. A review below me nailed it. The first bite was like a taste explosion, but by the end, it was like eating slightly charred toast. The bread reminded me of the first time I ate at CO. I had 2 burnt pizzas. I assumed the pizza wasn\\'t great, but apparently, I just had bad luck. I believe they had just changed the wood for the oven, so the temperature was probably to hot. I assume the pizza is way better when the coals burn down, letting the pizza cook slower. The pizza was still delicious, and I would go there all the time, if it was next door to me, but definitely not worth the trip just for the pizza, or even for the cool ambiance, which can be achieved in numerous other places in Brooklyn. But if you find yourself in Bushwick, definitely worth a visit, for a fun tasty time. We also had a broccoli salad, which turned out to be the biggest hit at the table, and I mad the mistake of ordering the squid ink pasta. What a giant piece of dog dung. Single-handedly reducing the stars for this place by 1. It was the most expensive single item on our bill. Tasted awful, and to top matters of, there were like 10 pieces of pasta in the whole dish. For 17 dollars, this dish must have been a joke. Seriously, imagine 10 Rigatoni in a plate, drenched in squid ink, and you will see my point. I was sure glad I filled up on pizza by the time this came out, or there might have been some issues. All in all a really fun adventure. I would come back again if I was in the area.',\n",
       " 'Came here on a cold Saturday evening to meet a friend for a quick bite and to satisfy a craving for some Cuban food. We walked in and noticed two spots at the bar area of this very small diner and decided to sit there rather than their few tables as it seemed very crowded and claustrophobic. Not much of a wait during prime dinner time considering how cold it was that day. After enjoying the Cuban decor and some Cuban music, I decided to go with a Cuban sandwich as the description pulled me in, \"Best in New York\". I can\\'t pass on that! My friend ordered the roast pork after our bartender suggested it. Next to us was one of the waitresses/managers who was having a quick dinner before her shift started. She was very bubbly and was livening up the already vivacious atmosphere of the restaurant. She shared with us sweet plantains which were some of the best I\\'ve had. We had some Cuban coffee to end the dining experience and it was also very good. Very sweet, strong double espresso. Our food came quickly and I began scarfing down the best Cuban sandwich in New York. Yup, the pork, ham and everything else was delicious especially with the chipotle mayo. Next time I have to ask for more of the sauce, so good. I tried my friends dish and found his roasted pork to be very delicious also. There were many sauces on the counter that he tried with it. We didn\\'t want to get too messy so we decided against ordered the grilled corn. In hindsight I regret it as it looked amazing when our neighbors ordered. Wish I had tried some of the cocktails also but was not in the mood at the time. Oh well, it gives me reason to come back!',\n",

I decided that a glass of tampranillo should accompany the spread and I found myself happily content before the dishes even arrived. I went for restaurant week with my girlfriend for dinner, so I missed out on the vibrant brunch scene, but that did not dampen the awesomeness of the sangria Calle Ocho is known for; how could I not try it? The fact that I forget what appetizer I had attests that it was neutral while my girlfriend's ceviche was almost unbearably spicy, although the dish is supposed to be as such so there can't be much complaint regarding the degree. The steak atop a little pseudo pie of roasted peppers/tomatoes and drizzled with sauce made the carnivore in me rejoice with glee. We finished the prix fixe with seemingly simply scoops of ice cream in exotic flavors like passion fruit. All they need to do now is move the men's bathroom to the front where the women's are located instead of the farthest reach past the kitchen. On the other hand, even the open presentation of the kitchen behind a chest-high fixture of frosted glass mixed with a utilitarian counter-top at which the waiters await your food to make its transition from the chef's hands is interesting to behold as you pass by. Or perhaps the sangria is partially responsible for that gem?\",\n",

My friend warned me that there might be a long line, but it was about 7pm when we got there on a Thursday and there was no line at all. As it moved closer to 730-8pm, there was a line to the door. Very limited seating. Place is small. Staff is SO nice. I love it. Absoultely better than Chipotle, but yet, way more unhealthy. I had the idea that Dos Toros will be quite similar to Chipotle. The menu style looked very similar. Burrito, Taco, or Quesadilla. Yes, they have Quesadillas which is a one up from Chipotle! But, on the down side, they don\\'t have \"salad\" bowls which is what I usually get from Chipotle when I\\'m trying to be healthy. Yes, I admit I\\'m a healthy eater. So you are able to choose carnitas, carne asada, grilled chicken, or just place rice and beans. Guac is always an extra charge, but WAY more cheaper than what Chipotle charges. Only .95 addition. Who wouldn\\'t want the guac? It\\'s so fresh and delicious! So I decided on the burrito bowl or what they call a \"plato.\" It was just rice, beans, your choice of meat, tomato/salsa, sour cream, cheese, green sauce and hot sauce. I couldn\\'t decide between carnitas or chicken, so I asked if I could have half -half. They guy was so sweet and gave me just what I wanted! I was very happy with the service. I got black beans, tomatoes, guac, green sauce and the medium hot sauce. I heard their other hot sauce is killer spicy. So I passed. I skipped on the sour cream and cheese, not my style. Most of the dishes with meat range from $3 (taco) to $7.50 (burrito or plato). If you want no mean, it\\'s way less of course. I was very happy with what I got. I devoured my food within minutes. The rice was a bit mushy to my liking, but flavored perfectly. Beans were spot on. Tomatoes were delish! The guac was my favorite. The Carnitas is less fatty than Chipotle which I really like. You could tell they braised it juuusssstttt right. The chicken was SO GOOD. I loved it. The quality of the food is definitely better than Chipotle, for sure. Sad part, no chopped lettuce. It would have made a big difference for me, but I guess a lot of people could live without. The serving size was perfect and I was very full. Love this place! Definitely will come back. Try to come off hours, or you will find yourself stuck in line and tableless.

Having found the perfect opportunity late one Sunday night, my date and I descended into the Spanish style interior and were immediately enveloped in the spacious but warmly lit, bustling atmosphere. We were seated immediately (w/o reservations) but even at 10p on a Sunday, there were only a few empty tables. While the wine list runs from the mid 30s well into the hundreds, there were a fair share of whites, reds and even sparkling from several regions, that were wallet-friendly. We were in the mood for a Spanish red (come on, it's tapas) and opted for the Tempranillo which was deliciously well-balanced (rich enough but not too rich, with a slight bite) and was really the perfect accompaniment for our spread. Now, onto the food...and let me say, I could've ordered at least 2 or 3 more plates, but didn't want to be that girl who eats everything in front of an oddly full date..oh well..will just have to go back :-) -Bacon-wrapped dates and olives (5.5; 6 to an order)...The dates were delicious, the olives were eeh...the salt upon salt didn't quite work -**Fried goat cheese (7.5; 4 to an order)...These were little golden balls from heaven. Airy, creamy, and when painted with the lavender honey, divine. -Grilled, smoked, mozzarella skewer (8; 1 scrumptious large skewer)...The smoked mozz was truly unctuous and i felt like i was outside around a campfire; the marinara tho was a bit pedestrian im sad to say and tasted almost canned--san marzanos are the best but it killed the dish--eat the skewer solo -*Arugula and treviso salad (9)...Simple, yes, but I always love one or two touches of fresh, slightly acidic palette cleansing veg-this was a great accompaniment and we devoured it -Char-grilled octopus (10)...I hardly ever ever do this, but WE SENT IT BACK. The octopus was over-cooked to a sad shoe-leathery degree and it was incredibly unpleasant...we were sad too as we both love sauteed calamari!..oh well, more dishes --**Tuna tartar with squash noodles (i think it was) (10.5)...this was absolutely fabulous--fresh and light with the perfect balance of acid, salt and base flavors --**Warm crab salad (12.5). Done and done. Get this dish. Now. Warm and cool, playful textures abound, mmm --*Seared foie gras (12; 2 small pieces of brioche) Foie gras is pretty hard to screw up and this was no exception; it had a really great mouthfeel and wasn't overly fatty tasting as the mango ginger chutney cut the oil and the pistachios added extra crunch; portion could feed one, i know it's tapas, but it was tiny tiny! --**Sea urchin risotto (13) (the date's choice)...To die. Truly an indulgence...I was actually glad there wasn't more because i'd have eaten large amounts of this buttery perfectly cooked risotto. --*******CRISPY BRUSSEL SPROUTS. (9.5) Are they as good as everyone says? YES. They're orgasmic even. It's the magic of the cool creme fraiche that comes as a surprise co-mingling with the warm bits of tender and crisp brussels.

       " \"Holy mackerel. Best. Meal. Ever. And I don't say that lightly - read some of my scathing reviews (I enjoy writing them). This place is amazeballs in every sense of the word. Gorgeous decor, phenomenal service (uhm synchronized table service!), and the FOOD. I was floored by everything down to the side of asparagus. Lets walk through this meal shall we? 1) Strawberry Basil Gazpacho - very refreshing palate cleanser with chunks of strawberries. 2) Crudo di Passera (fluke crudo, american sturgeon caviar, meyer lemon) - sounds so rich but surprisingly well balanced with a touch of olive oil at the bottom. Mmmmm sooooo tasty, I wanted to lick the plate! 3) Side of Asparagus (off-menu) - you think asparagus is asparagus right? WRONG. These super fresh spears tasted like a warm hug - meaty yet tender at the same time, exuding delicious asparagus flavor. 4) Anatra (long island duck, foie gras, ramps, mustard greens) - did not taste the ramps much BUT the duck was perfectly cooked with the most sumptuous flavor and easy texture. And then It was like the heavens opened up and said go ahead. INDULGE. You deserve this fresh foie gras. Let it melt into your taste buds and dissolve all your worries. Perfection. Portion sizes were just right leaving you enough room for dessert. 5) Budino di Cioccolato (chocolate cremeux, hazelnut praline, fior di latte gelato) - the most innovatively refreshing, yet creamy dessert in recent memory. The slightly sweet gelato pairs perfectly with the richness of the creme. The beautiful plating arrangement made every bite a charm. 6) Bon Bons - what a surprise treat at the end. Lavender truffle was true to taste and the pistachio financier was every nut lovers dream. Bonus tip: try the Chamomile Grappa as your nightcap. Goes down so smooth and pairs perfectly with dessert.\",\n",

Why she couldnt let us sit in the table seat?! Here are more things about bad service. The woman next to my seat said to her \"excuse me\" for several times, but she didnt answer. She answered after finishing POS job. Then the woman next to me asked her not to put ice in the coffee and she didnt answer. How rude! I dont want to go there again. I felt very unpleasant.

       " \"I can now cross off Ippudo's new Hell's Kitchen location off my ramen-to-do list. First, the wait: only about 30 minutes when I went (Sunday night between Christmas and New Year's). I'm guessing so many people were out of town, which helped the short wait time. But still, the crowd outside Totto Ramen on 52nd Street was laughably insane. And those poor souls had to wait outside in the cold. The great thing about Ippudo, both the new location and the original in the East Village, is that they have a separate waiting area where you can relax, warm up, and even get drinks. Second, the appetizers: Had the Ebi & Kani (Shrimp & Crab) Croquettes. The filling was a bit thin - not much shrimp or actual crabmeat. But nicely fried with panko. The Shiitake and Avocado Pagoda-Age had a nice presentation, but even after cutting the veggies into smaller pieces, it was still awkward to dip them into the sauce and then the yuzu and matcha salts. Third, the ramen: I went for the Shiromaru Hakata Classic. Deliciously creamy Tonkotsu broth and very meaty bamboo shoots. The chashu was on the thin side for me; I prefer nice and fatty chashu instead. I also added a soft boiled egg, which seemed overdone. The yolk was not particularly runny - it was even a bit chalky around the edges. Overall, the broth and noodles at Ippudo are superb, but the toppings need some fine-tuning. Fourth, the dessert: Matcha ice cream with mochi and red bean. It came with a shot of sweetened milk (maybe soy?). I have a big sweet tooth, but even I would not recommend pouring the whole shot of sweet milk over the ice cream. Fifth, the ambiance and service: This is where Ippudo is well-worth the money. As I mentioned above, the separate waiting area is a big, BIG seller for me. No one hovering over you as you eat your ramen. Also, there is ample space and seating, so no squishing people at a table or at the ramen bar. And the servers are very polite and friendly, even offering to take our photo! NOTE: No strollers or baby chairs. The host tried to explain that this family would have to leave their giant stroller at the front (outside), and their 2-yr-old would have to sit in a normal chair. (Also, who brings a 2-yr-old out for $15 ramen on a Sunday night???) And they most likely try to sit couples at the bar and save the tables for larger parties. This was a point of contention for a high-maintenance couple that refused to sit at the bar upstairs and demanded a table on the first floor...\",\n",

Which is why it is a shame that I have changed my opinion of this place. \\xa0 I took friends there in late October for a special going-away dinner. When I made the reservation, I told the girl that this was a special dinner, that the people I was bringing had never been there before, and I requested the seating along the far wall where one side is like booth seats with pillows (which my friend would have loved). She said they would write it in as a request. Requests have never been a problem in the past, so I said ok. It was Monday when I made the reservation (which was for Friday) so I figured it was more than enough time. We showed up on time, and, without a word about my request, the girl shows us to our table - a regular table, by the window (it\\'s usually chilly by the windows here. I have to wear my coat). I politely reminded her about my request when I had made the reservation five days ago. She IMMEDIATELY got defensive and snippy and said \"It was just a REQUEST. I said I\\'d see what I can do! That table is not available!\" The girl who spoke to me this way was the young dark-haired girl (and she was the one I had spoken to on the phone.) I explained that this was a special dinner, that I had purposely made the reservation early for this express purpose, that we were so excited for our friends to experience this restaurant (all things you would think any restaurant - especially one in Hartford - would be thrilled to hear). NOPE. The girl got ruder and ruder, raised her voice to me (!) to the point that other customers started to stare. That made it incredibly uncomfortable for us, as the hostess stand is at the front of the place, so you basically feel like your whole awkward conversation is on display for all to hear. As soon as this girl raised her voice to me, my friends (who were seated at the table) immediately got up and walked out. I followed. None of us wanted to eat in an establishment that treats loyal customers this way. And I wound up apologizing profusely to my friends for such embarrassing treatment, and for such a rocky start to what was supposed to be a special evening.

We roughly waited around 45 minutes before we finally got seated. However before we were seated, another party of 3 was seated before us and they were AFTER us on the wait list. I was a little confused so I asked the hostess why we weren't seated first and she AVOIDED my question with irrelevant answers saying that our wait time would be around 10 minutes or less if we divide our party. We all ordered the Totto Miso Ramen ($11). When our order came, the chef accidentally gave me pork instead of chicken but I just kept the pork because I didn't want to wait. The waiter was nice enough to give me chicken on the side for free. I had extremely high exception for the ramen but was very disappointed because the ramen tasted very blend.

The thai iced tea on the other hand, not so good. I didn't think it was possible to ruin thai iced tea, but I really did not enjoy it. For our entrees we got thai chicken red curry which, although was a strange pink in color that I would have never associated with food, wasn't bad. We also got the Coriander Garlic chicken, which I really enjoyed. If I have any suggestions for this place it is to definitely emphasize that you want spice. I guess the waiter thought we were too American looking to be able to handle heat because after reassuring him 3 times that I wanted medium, my food was still somewhat bland and heat-less.

That said, we were so excited and kept talking about the ramen all night. \\xa0Just like a good date, you got to make sure to go back for seconds and see that you weren't hallucinating. \\xa0Well we went back on a Monday since people said there was no wait at 3 p.m. \\xa0Indeed we only had to wait 20 minutes to get in. \\xa0This time however my spicy ramen was way too spicy to taste the broth and the pork was a bit overdone. \\xa0I suspect this is because the lunch crowd has different chefs than the dinner crowd and maybe the broth hasn't been as developed. Bottom line: if you are willing to wait (put your name down and come back every 20-30 minutes depending on what day of the week you go), this is consistently delicious ramen.

Get down while you sit down ladies! So the pizza. Of the four we tried, the Torrina was my favorite, with the clam pizza a close second. They do such a good job of balancing the flavors, you can taste every one of the toppings. The Funghi (wild mushroom with riccotta cream) was a bit bland for me, easily remedied with a dash of the table cheese and pepper flakes. Not cheap ass run of the mill psuedo-Parmesan mind you, but some obviously high quality tasty stuff. The selection of small plates looks super intriguing. Not the kind of fare you usually see at a pizza joint. Everyone at the table agreed the crispy mac and cheese wedge was epic. It came on a bed of greens lightly dressed with some tangy concoction, cutting the richness of the mac and cheese perfectly. Stupid bargain at $4. The blue crab nachos were delicious and went quick at our table. Service was quite good. Friendly and attentive. I can see the point others make about the lack of a hostess when you immediately enter. You have to go in and to the left, the desk is next to the bar. Maybe a sign could help? The bar has some infused spirits really interesting. We had the mango habenero, delish sweet burn. Next time I'll try the fennel/honey tangerine vodka.

(You'll probably need to ask for another round of pita bread.) The menu isn't very, very long, but there are lots of awesome things to choose from. I had the When Veggie Met Sally salad, which was basic but had an awesome veggie patty dispersed around it. The chicken sandwich, I was told, was also good. I have a feeling - and have heard - that brunch is the ideal time to come here. I do plan to come back for brunch because that's my favorite meal, but I wouldn't totally diss dinner. Dinner is a good time to come, as well. Penelope has a very chill atmosphere and delicious food.\",\n",

Went here on a tuesday night on a double date with wifey, Michael K, and Natalie. Never been here before but I always drive by this place when I'm headed towards the Jackie Robinson Parkway and going to BK to work. Has definitely been on my bucket list for awhile now. We were seated close to the entrance. The establishment is not big, per se, but it is long and narrow and operating out of a small kitchen. A full sized bar commands the place and is very prominent upon entering. We decided to order a bevy of plates , so we can munch on a few things rather than individual portions. At first, we ordered a wine bottle for the table : Cabernet Sauvignon, because we classy like that. The appetizers consisted of an amazing hummus plate with chickpeas in the middle and partially oven toasted pita bread and we also opted for the lamb meatballs with pureed cauliflower ( my choice of course because i love broccoli's less know cousin). The appetizers were great and very well made, i was surprised. I didn't know what to expect on Austin St. sometimes because a lot of the relatively new restaurants flop within six months of opening. On to the entrees, we had the : Kale Chicken Salad with herb croutons and Steak Salad. Both were very good and we didn't order to much due to it being so late. I enjoyed the dim lit, intimate atmosphere, especially in a local spot. Heard from my sitter that Brunch here is pretty amazing as well. Will be returning to try a few more items on the dinner menu such as the cheese boards, seared salmon with cauliflower and spinach, and also the J&N burger. ( Yes, i like to keep my dinner options open. Don't you?). check this place out , yelpers..\",\n",

Every time a group gets seated or ramen is being served to someone, the whole staff just starts shouting something in Japanese- or so you think it's Japanese.

Usually I'm not into the sweet/savory flavor combination, usually because people over salt and over sweeten, but it worked pretty well. I only wish the waffle was fresher from the maker, it was room temperature when it reached the table and the butter was stone cold so it took work to spread the butter around. All in all, I acknowledge Maharlika follows through with giving its customers a very nice dining experience, and you will enjoy it if you're newbies to filipino food, but it was overwhelmingly cramped for me.

My dislike was the rissotto was not friendly, I know that sounds silly but it was more than al dente, there was bite to it. This was a bit firmer than undercooked rice which was really disappointing. I also learned that I don\\'t like mussels in beer, steamed in wine is definitely better! The beer flavor was overwhelming and not pleasant to dipping bread, might as well have been drinking the beer at tap.

If a place has the hype that it itself created, does it have to live up to your expectations? Yes. Yes it does. Night after night. Season after season. I've been waiting on dining with the Smookler clan for some time. It was well worth the wait. The atmosphere is cozy with great interior design. The decor was what I would expect from the ramen I was about to enjoy. It was classy yet modest and made me feel at home. I was happy to see the owners walking around humbly conversing with their night II guests. Chef picked up a mop at one point. It's things like that I appreciate. This is his blood sweat and tare and his activeness in running the operations shows his pride and expectations for care. Priceless. The U&I - This was near perfect. A mere 5-6 ingredient dish whereby each part played it's role perfectly. The flavors were subtle, sweet, and fresh. 3 large pieces of uni on top of perfectly sticky rice that would bring a smile to any Asian. The maguro was had a great texture - season's end ikura balanced out the entire dish along with some fairly good quality wasabi. The Spicy Miso - This bowl probably stands as one of the top 3 Miso Ramen/Spicy Miso bowls in the city hands down. I've had them all. It's been a mission for 4 years. That doesn't make me qualified, it makes me happy. The noodles were insane. They were tsukemen style noodles in a rich spicy miso pork based broth. Kikurage comes stock along with chopped pork, menma, and corn. I added the onsen tomago and urge you to as well. Flavors were fresh. They were matured.

The menu is straightforward, cash only, but also fairly inexpensive. \\xa0The option for cheap carafs of wine and some Brooklyn brewery beer on the list makes it a nice addition. \\xa0The place is large, and has the standard, red and white checkered cloth tables. \\xa0The place is also crammed with tourists from everywhere and anywhere. We figured if we were to judge the pizza, we would go for the basic. \\xa0Plain, cheese, mozzarella and perhaps some basil. \\xa0We ordered, had a drink, waited a little and it arrived. \\xa0The pizzas are either small or large, if you are dining for two get a small it is more than susbstantial. I am honestly going to say I don't know what I think about what I was tasting. \\xa0The dough was actually very bready, really unique. \\xa0Nothing was crisp or burnt. \\xa0However, I was expecting some flavor from the cheese, and it was rather bland. \\xa0Now Mozeralla is pretty neutral to begin with, but there wasn't much still going on here, the tomato sauce seemed almost ordinary. \\xa0It was still tasty without question but could they have thrown more than one or two measly basil leaves on the pie? \\xa0One slice seemed to find a stragler topping, it seemed to be pepperoni or perhaps Italian sauasage. \\xa0Grabbing a chomp away from my dining companion who doesn't like pepperoni, it was very nicely spiced, nothing like pepperoni or sausage toppings you find on commercial pizza at all. I am not convinced this is the best pizza to be had in the NYC area, and if I would have waited eons to get in to taste it I probably would have been really dissapointed. It's probably only a once in a lifetime thing for me, so I am done. \\xa0If I could go in again with little effort, I would try another pie with more toppings. \\xa0But wait more than 5 - 10 minutes to get in? \\xa0I think there's plenty of other places worth trying so I wouldn't do that.\",\n",

I would even say the pasta at Otto is better. That's just me. Started off with the sweet corn and chili antipasto, it was good, not great. It literally is what it is, cold sweet corn kernels and minced chilis. Had the bucatini (spelling?), it was a bit too al dente for my taste. The sauce was very good, (spicy tomato/onion) but in words of Bourdain, a good sauce cannot save a poor noodle, not to say this was poor, but I couldn't get over the hard center. Next, had the special for the day, the rack of lamb. As far as lamb goes, it was melty, came right off the bone, had a nice acidity to cut some of the grease, but the fatty greasy-ness was just too overwhelming for me. 6 times out of 10, I'll eat the globs of fat, but this time was just a little too much for me. Actually after eating it, I couldn't get the feeling off my lips. This is a personal bias, so don't take my word for it. Finally ended with the black pepper panna cotta with stone fruit. Sounds weird, but it was very good, cool, refreshing, and at time, you tend to get some bite from the pepper. Overall, a nice dining experience, but it was nothing I was wow-ed by.

Look, I personally don't feel this is the best chocolate chip cookie in NYC hands down but it is obviously a strong contender and Maman is a wonderful spot to to relax over a cappuccino and a cookie in SoHo. Also, little French touches like old Parisian music playing over gritty amplifiers, paper straws the likes of which you rarely see in the US, a range of Eurpoean teas and coffees, and beautiful decor all add to the enjoyment. I was a bit sad they didn't have an in-house iced tea and had to actually brew it for me on the spot (as this took some time) and also I can always just buy Harney and Sons myself, but obviously this is nit picking. When I came here much of what they had was sold out as the popularity of Maman is obviously beginning to catch up with it a bit. Once they catch up to the demand it will be a lot better since just in the 10 minutes I was there maybe 3 or 4 groups saw that they were pretty cleaned out and left.

I went to undergrad in Philly so trust me, I speak cheesesteak. The locals will tell you (and I agree) that the best cheesesteak shops can be found tucked away in the neighborhoods. To be honest, in my entire four years of college, I never had reason to trek down to Pat\\'s or Geno\\'s. My husband, however, wanted to experience the whole blinking light, mano-a-mano rivalry between Geno\\'s and Pat\\'s. So on our way home after an amazing day trip in Philly, we stopped at Geno\\'s. (We had done Pat\\'s before, and while it wasn\\'t the best I ever had, it was a solid cheesesteak.) For a place that prides itself on being a Philly landmark, you\\'d think they\\'d cater to the tourist. Most locals and Philly foodies already avoid this place like the plague. However, Geno\\'s wants the tourist to cater to them. You better learn the rules of ordering before you step to the counter or else you will be shunned. I get that part of the mystique of the place is the rudeness and the whole \"wit or wittout\" lingo, but it\\'s not just a schtick with them. It\\'s really how they are. Beware if you try ordering your fries and drinks from the cheesesteak window. They will yell at you for not knowing or assuming that the window at the far end of the building is where you get your fries and sodas. Now let\\'s talk about what Geno\\'s calls a cheesesteak. They don\\'t chop the meat. It\\'s sliced thick and is very chewy and flavorless. The bread was stale and the fries were rather forgettable. If you find yourself torn Geno\\'s and Pat\\'s, I\\'d tell you to go across the street to Pat\\'s. They have the better food, and their outdoor decor isn\\'t as fussy and gimmicky as Geno\\'s. If you want the best of the best in Philly cheesesteaks, head down to Tony Luke\\'s on Oregon Ave, or Jim\\'s at 4th and South. I definitely can vouch for Jim\\'s far superior cheesesteak.

       " \"I can't tell you how much I was looking forward to visiting PT during Brooklyn's Restaurant Week. If not for Dine-In Brooklyn and the various reviews, I would have never found this gem. [ Imagine my anxiety then, when my date showed up 20 minutes late. I really have to give the men at PT props for not bothering me about whether the other half of my reservation was on his or her way. They never once pressured me to give my table away when other couples without reservations showed up together ::cough::on time*ahem*whatever. Probably didn't want to mess with this damsel in a dress in distress. ] I was pleasantly surprised to walk down into this warm, inviting nook of a restaurant. With its unassuming location on Bedford Avenue, you'd think it was just another spot to be filled with trendy and/or obnoxious hipster folk. Not so. The dim lighting, exposed wood and brick interior make for quite the romantic meal. It was beautiful! Contrary to what other people have mentioned, I didn't find the stools to be cumbersome at all. I felt that, considering the area, PT managed to find a nice balance between vintage and rustic design. If not for the ambiance, I will definitely return for the food. Their menu is fantastic. I started with an organic beet salad and can probably say it was my favorite part of the meal. I love beets and was impressed by the way they showcased them in this nutty little starter... yum! \\xa0My main dish was a light fish wrapped in thinly sliced zucchini. Good, but nothing to write home about. The desserts, however, were tantalizing! We are by no means big on wine, but both of us thoroughly enjoyed the glasses suggested to us by our server. They complemented our dishes very well. Their carefully selected wine list was informative in that it detailed the origin and what kind of grape was used, which I liked. I highly recommend this spot for your next date. Even if you end up sitting next to another couple, the atmosphere easily makes you feel like you two are in your own little world. I can't wait to go back to try their pasta -- and the garden!\",\n",

I thought at first this was due to the recent Sandy black out that their machine wasn't up and running again, but nope. SUPPER ACCEPTS ONLY CASH, ALL THE TIME. If you get a bottle of wine and some beers, 2-3 appetizers, and a main entree for each within a group of 4 friends, and a dessert to share, I'd estimate having an extra $60-80 on you for the meal including tip. If you don't remember this, there is a Chase right next door, but they charge $3 for an out of network transaction. Plan accordingly if you hate getting ripped off by large banking institutions like I do. With the regard to the food, it was all excellent. Nothing here is a rip off. From the simple sides of bread with white beans, roasted mushrooms, and salad to the hearty mains like butter & lemon pasta or my veal shank, it was all perfectly salted, seasoned, and cooked. No one didn't love what they got and not one else didn't enjoy taste testing it! We couldn't decide on what dessert to finish off with and so the waiter was kind enough to get us one on the house so we could try the two we were debating between. I'm not usually a huge fan of tiramisu but this was heaven- not overly soaked in rum, thus not too spongey or soggy, and with delicately fresh whipped cream, mMmmm. If I haven't made your mouth water yet, the chocolate cake was actually better ;) Service in the basement is perhaps a little slower because they forget you're down there. I won't knock them too much for this, since we were enjoying each other's company and probably sent our waiter away a few times before knowing what we wanted. The restaurant is a bit tight to maneuver thru, so if the basement is open I would highly recommend requesting seats here. We got seated there on a whim, and one half of the long tables is a big plush pillowed bench that makes you feel like maharaja sitting in it. My one gripe about this place, and about every other seemingly 5-star worthy eatery that will never get the full 5 from me, is that they pay NO special attention whatsoever to their plating techniques!! I mean, really??!! This place is Michelin recommended, Zagat rated, Time Out NY rave reviewed, and they just slop the food on what looks like cafeteria dishes and expect me to believe that the market value of Burrata is really $22!?? I paid for it didn't I, I'm not complaining that it's overpriced. I'm complaining that for slightly overpriced, albeit delicious food, a bit more care for the presentation would go a long way in my feeling a little ripped off or not.

Most people in the restaurant were wearing their winter jackets still. My guess is when it is warmer out the place is perfectly comfortable, but it was below 20 outside that day and the room was definitely struggling to heat up. We decided to order the antipasti plate and the pear flat bread. The flat bread was the highlight of the night. The antipasti plate was a huge disappointment. It was boring and basically just a plate of slightly cooked, poorly marinated and under-seasoned vegetables. I opted to get the sole for my entree, and again I got a plate of very bland fish and sides. The green beans were actually under cooked and had no flavor other than a bit of olive oil brushed on. The fish was dry, and the tabouli salad side dish was decent but nothing special. And everything was just kind of put on the plate with no care of presentation. When I go out for a nice, high end meal, it is typical that not only the food tastes good, but the plating is very beautiful as well. My friends ordered the tuna and the pork chop and they seemed pleased, so perhaps I didn\\'t order the \"right thing.\" But at the same time, in my opinion, \\xa0a good restaurant doesn\\'t have a wrong thing to order, everything should taste great. For the record, I am someone who is a huge foodie and I have eaten at some top rated restaurants.

I get that Philly isn\\'t as much a food destination as some other cities, however, I know I am not the only one in this city who is a foodie and appreciates amazing food, so to those people I would say this: this restaurant probably would not last in cities like NYC, Chicago, or other \"foodie\" cities.

       " 'Before my visit here on Monday night, I only knew chef/owner Scott Conant from his terse comments as one of the harsher judges on the \"Chopped\" competition series on what else, the Food Network. I didn\\'t even know he owned Scarpetta although I had heard about the place from my East Coast friends for the past several years. Lucky me I was in New York on the first day of a new job, a business trip with my manager and a local colleague, and as it turned out, we are all foodies. The first thing that strikes you when you enter Scarpetta is how incredibly dark it is. I get the cosmopolitan ambiance they are trying to capture here, but personally I found it a bit excessive given how much effort is placed on the presentation of the food at least judging from the website. Funny thing is I just read about a new app on TechCrunch called Chefs Feed in which famous chefs list their absolute favorite dishes at other chefs\\' restaurants. I downloaded it and found the $19 Creamy Polenta with Fricassee of Truffled Mushrooms mentioned with gusto by Chris Santos of Beauty & Essex. By coincidence, I recently saw the tail end of an episode of the Food Network\\'s \"The Best Thing I Ever Made\" where Conant was making his signature dish. Sold. It was sensational - luxuriant with the chicken-infused morels and preserved truffles almost as velvety as the cream-based polenta itself (see photo). My dining companions agreed. But even before the polenta came one of the best bread baskets I think I\\'ve ever devoured. It was filled with not only thick slices of rustic Italian bread and foccacia but unexpected slabs of Stromboli oozing with salami and mozzarella, all of which was quickly devoured (see photo). The three condiments were almost unnecessary, but they were excellent - a buttery mascarpone, a citrus-herb-infused extra virgin olive oil, and an eggplant caponata. Just as we were savoring the polenta, the $25 Short Rib Agnolotti arrived, and the platter presented melt-in-your-mouth pieces of short rib into a ravioli-like folded pasta and blended them with root vegetables in a horseradish brown butter (see photo). Gone too soon. The entrees came in quick order, and each provided individual pleasures. The $34 Fennel-Spiced Black Cod came in the form of two large filets with the crispy skin left intact and piled atop concentrated tomatoes and artichoke leaves. It was all surrounded by a creamy mantecato & black olive oil sauce that brought the proper amount of decadence to the fish (see photo). The $33 Branzino was more simply presented with a large piece of the seabass covered in bottarga (tuna roe) breadcrumbs and sitting atop a blend of sunchokes, cotechino (salami) and leeks (see photo). Fish is definitely a specialty here, but I had the rock star of the night, the $33 Spiced Duck Breast surrounded by a foie gras emulsion (yes, it was a brownish orange foam) and served with butternut squash, Tuscan kale and pickled raisins (see photo). It was succulent as you would expect but with unexpected flavors that kept my palate tantalized. Mere mortals would have stopped there, but an expense account empowered us to move forward with the decadent dessert selection at $12 a pop. First up was the Amadei Chocolate Cake with a salted caramel gelato (a tad too bland) and chocolate butterscotch (see photo). The cake was deceptively small, but the Italian chocolate was obscenely rich. The second was the Sesame-Honey Semifreddo, which was milk chocolate mousse shaped like biscotti with a sweet potato gratin and malted chocolate crumble accompaniment (see photo). Both were lovely, but the unexpected surprise was the Coconut Panna Cotta, a milky tropical creation sitting in a pool of cool guava sauce with a sprinkling of caramelized pineapple. Delicioso, Mr. Conant. You\\'re not chopped. FOOD - 5 stars...masterful execution of dishes that seem deceptively simple in concept with the polenta and panna cotta the genuine standouts of the evening AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...personally thought it was too dark to allow the eyes to complete the picture of the luscious food SERVICE - 4 stars...solid if a bit unctuous, almost too attentive perhaps due to the lateness of the hour TOTAL - 5 stars...Conant definitely knows his food',\n",

Lovely space and lovely cocktails for sure, my concern was with the service and approach to our questions.. Our waitress, was clearly not happy to be serving us, rolling her eyes when there was indecision at the table (to be expected, not everyone decides simultaneously), being disrespectful when we followed up about drinks not delivered, and was clearing drinking shots at the bar in full view of us. At the end of the evening we asked to speak to the duty manager and were informed that there was not one on site. Another employee confirmed there was no licensed manager of the premises to address our service concerns, and we were instructed to leave \"quietly\". I was not aware that voicing concern was grounds for being tossed out. For a higher end cocktail bar, in which we sat mildly as a group all evening, to be brushed off when we had concerns we wished to discuss with a manager, unacceptable. Also I thought liquor laws required a licensed manager to be available. It tarnished my whole experience of the place. Would be very unlikely to go back. I have written to the bar, and will take it to the licensing authority happily, as they seemed completely unconcerned with our legitimate requests. I am normally a very balanced Yelp reviewer, but this is one of the more disgraceful experiences in NYC in many a year. May I politely say - screw you.

I ordered the beet salad special and the grilled calamari over arugula. I'm a fan of almost anything containing beets, but this was just not good. It didn't taste fresh or well thought out at all. The grilled calamari smelled really fishy and was very very tough. I had a hard time eating/cutting it. My friends all ordered pasta - the artichoke ravioli was the best by far, the other dishes were OK. The house wine was good and cheap, no complaints there. The service was average. They did their job, and that's about it. If I went by myself, I would give this place 1 star, just for the calamari. Out of 4 people's apps and entrees, only 1 dish was worth coming back for.

Never order a side dish just for yourself. They are large, and even our waiter referred to them as \"family style.\" The potatoes were especially tasty with just the right balance of cheese and creaminess. Our waiter accommodated us by providing extra plates to share the dessert. The coffee cups are huge. They are more like soup bowls. If you\\'re full, think twice about ordering coffee. In fact, think twice about ordering it at all. It was awful. I like strong coffee but this was ridiculous. I had to add so much cream that the coffee got cold.

The further away from civilization and the harder-to-get-to location, the more the rest of us want to go. But location is one thing, food is another. Bunker provides a satisfying eating experience. The menu is relatively short and the friendly waitstaff can talk at length about the cooking styles and the subtle flavors of what is essentially a collection of street food items. Flavors were there, and the prices ($8-$12 on average per dish) justified the better-than-average quality of ingredients. Chicken Pho Ga, the warm-weather seasonal stand-in for classic beef pho, was the complete show stealer; I can't imagine a more flavorful broth. Subtly sweet and fragrant with star anise, ginger and other aromatics; if pho is the ultimate test for a Vietnamese place, Bunker passes with flying colors. Tom Thit Ram or caramelized jumbo shrimp with bacon was the top recommendation of our waiter and the flavors of caramelized shrimp came across nicely with the crispy bits of bacon. The Cha Ca La Vong seems to be the most hyped dish on the menu, presenting fish rubbed in turmeric, then fried and served with copious clumps of crispy fresh dill. The dish does provide that unexpected flavor combination but one wouldn't be doing a disfavor to the table by potentially skipping it.

For $6 I was able to get a 3 Shrimp Takoyaki and 3 Sausage Takoyaki. Both were quite tasty and I liked all the condiments and toppings. Lots of flavor and it definitely filled me up for lunch. Great for a snack in the area and love the cute logo!\",\n",

       " \"Winter Restaurant Week 2010 here we come!! Myself and 3 friends went to Perry St. for Restaurant Week which was fantastic. There were two options for every course. I went with the crab dumpling, slow cooked salmon, and the exotic fruit desert. The crab dumpling had some of the freshest crab I ever had, with a perfectly cooked steamed wrap loosely places outside the crab meat, and a sweet/spicy asian sauce with some crunchy julienned zucchini (?). Really really good, light and refreshing. THE BEST PART OF THE WHOLE MEAL was the slow-cooked salmon and damn, did they cook it slow!! Not because it took a long time to get to the table, but because that was the lightest, most perfectly cooked, freshest salmon I ever had. It was just the way I like it. Super light and barely flaky (because it was cooked so lightly!). The salmon was over some chopped parsnips and red cabbage which had a hint of cider vinegar, horseradish and honey. The dessert was 'meh..'.. the ice cream was the best part... the lil biscotti on the top was not very nice and the overcooked fruit in simple syrup was a bit too... well, simple. The service was good, but slightly snooty - but I guess that can be expected from this sort of place. The front dining area was freezing! They really need to work on their heat control over there, but overall, I loved it. Very very good value for restaurant week. I highly recommend!\",\n",

I have had better however this isn't saying it was bad just not amazing. \\xa0 Cleanliness : you can tell the owner take pride in keeping this place clean. We walked in and you could smell how clean the place was. Atmosphere: The restaurant is not to big I would say it is a good size for a sushi restaurant. They music is nice and relaxing. The background noise was not to loud too. Over all I would recommend this place to any friend.\",\n",

       " \"My review of the Brindle Room is solely reflective of the lunch experience (the only time I go). I'm not a huge fan of the location, as it's a bit of a hike from anything but the L (and do I ever abhor the L). But I think the value proposition of the lunch burger is makes it one of the best lunch deals in the city. And given that every time I've been for a weekday afternoon it's been relatively empty (there is nothing worse than waiting for lunch, as we all have things to do), it's the perfect mix of convenience, price and flavor. For $12, you get a lovely burger with a solid dry-aged funk ($2 less than what you'll find on the dinner menu). Are there better burgers in this city? Sure--no one is suggesting that this is better than Raoul's or Minetta. But the beef has a lot more flavor than your typical gastropub burger that usually comes at the same price point. The fries, while occasionally over-salted, are plentiful and well-cooked. It is better than the comparably-reviewed lunch-only burger at Fritzl's Lunchbox, and doesn't require me to hike my ass all the way out to Bushwick. While perhaps not a destination spot, Brindle Room is always a solid choice if you happen to be in the neighborhood. And their daytime cocktails are the perfect way to get a nice respite in an otherwise busy day.\",\n",

       " \"I went here for dinner last night with a friend and was amazed by the experience, both the positives and negatives. First the negatives: 1 - As other people have pointed out, expect a wait. If you're impatient, either go early, maybe a late lunch/early dinner (you can take advantage of the lunch menu), or go late, around 9:30. Oh and do this during the week, weekends are a different story, no matter what, expect a wait. 2 - The later you go, the more likely they are to run out of dessert, and sometimes that can just be wrong. I mean, sometimes you just want dessert, right? Right? Worst case if they run out though, head two blocks up to Martha's Country Bakery and you should be good. Now the positives: 1 - Be hungry, they're going to feed you. As soon as you're seated, expect to be met with a half loaf of wonderful bread drizzled with delicious Greek Extra Virgin Olive Oil. The bread last night was still warm and soaked up the oil on the plate as we devoured it. 2 - The portion sizes are intimidating, so, see positive number 1. My friend and I decided we wanted a Greek Salad and I had the opportunity to see a large Greek Salad delivered to a table while waiting. The bowl was honestly bigger than my entire head and overflowing with tomatoes, onions, olives and most importantly chunks and more chinks of feta cheese (this is a good thing). Seeing that it was nearing 10PM when we were seated, we decided on a small salad (mainly b/c my friend saw my eyes bulge when I saw the size of the large). When that was brought out, the bowl was still as big as my face - I have to take off at least an inch or two for my forehead - and just as stuffed as the large. We gave up on finishing it, instead deciding to wait for our entrees. I had the grilled baby shark (we felt bad b/c it was a baby, but then realized that well, it's a shark) and lemon potatoes, my friend the grilled octopus - the only reason we went there, she was dreaming of octopus (I can only hope in a good way). Both portions were massive, the shark was about 10 pieces with a garlic dip and the octopus was an appetizer size, yet still took up an entire plate. 3 - The quality of the food. It was superb. The shark was grilled and seasoned perfectly, I had never had shark before, that was part of the reason I ordered it, but when it hit my tongue, it felt as if the meat just melted my mouth was filled with a nice charred taste from the grill, and a brilliant sweetness from the oil drizzled on the fish (Oh, big warning, expect to find everything drizzled in sweet perfect olive oil). I enjoyed every piece I ate, as did my friend when we shared. Which allowed me to be surprised by how steak like octopus is. I was expecting something more akin to squid, but instead got something like sirloin. It was meaty, but not tough. Also grilled, also drizzled with oil. What we had was perfect. 4 - The wine was surprisingly good for a house offering. We ordered a half carafe of the house white since at $9 it made more sense since we both figured we'd drink more than one glass priced at $4. Neither of us seemed to know much about Greek wines so we went for the house offering. I'm used to those being a bit weaker and also not very satisfying. But this was. In fact, after getting up at the end of our meal, we both felt slightly lightheaded. A nice change from the usual house wine. Finally, the service was great. I'm not sure if it was the time of day, and I expect it was, but our order was delivered promptly and we got the check right after asking for it.\",\n",
